1. LL3M Overview
   LL3M is an innovative framework where multiple Large Language Model (LLM) agents automatically generate Python code to create 
   and edit 3D assets in Blender.
   By following user text instructions, LL3M enables both creative and precise shape generation, 
   as well as complex geometric manipulations expressed directly in code.
   Unlike conventional 3D modeling tools, it offers unconstrained asset creation and fine-grained interaction.
   The generated Blender code is clear, with high parameter transparency, allowing users or agents to easily modify 
   and iteratively improve it.
   LL3M demonstrates wide-ranging capabilities in 3D asset handling, including consistent stylization, material editing, 
   and hierarchical structuring.

2. Pipeline Overview
   The pipeline consists of three key stages:
   -a. Initial Generation: Creates basic forms while LL3M automatically detects and corrects logically inappropriate structures or 
       overly simple geometry.
   -b. Automated Refinement: Applies more sophisticated modifications, capturing complex forms and relationships.
   -c. User Feedback Integration: Incorporates additional user edits, enabling interactive and iterative 3D asset creation.
   Each stage leverages the division of roles among agents, ensuring iterative, progressive improvement.

3. Gallery & Capabilities
   -a. Diverse Shape Generation: Examples include windmills, pianos, and drum sets, realized through code with detailed arrangements.
   -b. Consistent Style Application: A single directive like “steampunk” can be applied across different meshes (e.g., hats) 
                                     to produce varied yet stylistically coherent results.
   -c. Material Editing: For instance, defining a separate shader node for a blade section allows localized material changes.

4. Code Interpretability
   -a. The generated code contains structured logic, clear variable names, and comments, making it easy to understand and modify.
   -b. Example: users can directly adjust keyboard patterns or key width variables.
   -c. Blender nodes and parameters are exposed transparently, enabling intuitive adjustment of visual properties such as 
       colors and patterns.

5. Reusability & Generality
   -a. Core code patterns (loops, modifiers, node setups) are reused across different shapes.
   -b. This modularity allows versatile and easily editable code generation across varied prompts.

6. Scene Composition & Hierarchy
   -a. LL3M can generate multiple objects and automatically arrange them through instancing and parenting.
   -b. Example: when creating a lamp, parent-child relationships are encoded so transformations propagate hierarchically.
   -c. Each part receives a meaningful semantic name, enabling efficient management within Blender’s scene graph.
