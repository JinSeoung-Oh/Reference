The paper titled "A Theory of Foundational Meaning Generation in Autonomous Systems, Natural & Artificial"
by Kristinn R. Thórisson and Gregorio Talevi proposes a comprehensive theory of meaning generation that applies to both natural and artificial systems. 
The theory is designed to explain how meaning is generated in autonomous agents and is positioned
as a framework that could be implemented in artificial general intelligence (AGI) systems. 
The authors emphasize that meaning and autonomy are intertwined, arguing that meaning generation is essential for true autonomy, and vice versa.

1. Distinction Between Foundational and Semantic Meaning:
   The paper distinguishes between foundational meaning, which is deeply tied to an agent's goals, actions, and experiences, and semantic meaning, 
   which is related to the interpretation of symbols and language. Foundational meaning is more complex
   and involves understanding how new information impacts an agent's goals and behavior.

2. Motivation for a Theory of Meaning:
   The authors argue that while the concept of meaning has been extensively studied in philosophy, linguistics, and cognitive science,
   there is still no detailed and prescriptive theory that can be applied to the design of intelligent systems. 
   The theory proposed here aims to fill that gap by providing a framework that explains how autonomous systems can generate and use meaning.

3. Conceptual Framework:
   The theory introduces several core concepts, including:
   -1. World (W): A formal description of the environment, including variables, functions, and relationships that an agent interacts with.
   -2. Situation (σ): The subset of the world that an agent can observe and manipulate at any given time.
   -3. Agent (A): An autonomous system with sensors, actuators, and a controller (mind) that processes information and makes decisions based on goals and available knowledge.
   -4. Goals and Plans: An agent's goals drive its actions, and these goals are organized hierarchically, with top-level goals derived from the agent's primary purpose.

4. Meaning Generation Process:
   Foundational meaning is generated when an agent links new information (I) to its existing goals, knowledge, and predictions. 
   The process involves reasoning over causal models and updating goals and plans based on the new information.
   This dynamic process is referred to as constructing an "M-structure," which encapsulates the agent’s understanding of its current situation and how it relates to its goals.

5. Causal Models and Reliability:
   Causal models are central to the theory, as they allow an agent to predict the outcomes of its actions and adjust its goals accordingly. 
   The reliability of these models is key to ensuring that the meaning generated is accurate and useful for the agent’s decision-making.

6. Importance of the 'Now':
   The paper emphasizes that meaning generation is always bound to the present moment ("now").
   Autonomous agents must operate within the constraints of time and space, making real-time predictions and decisions based on the information available in the present. 
   This time-sensitive nature of meaning generation is critical for effective control and decision-making.

7. Interdependence of Autonomy and Meaning:
   The theory argues that autonomy and meaning are mutually dependent. 
   An agent cannot be truly autonomous without the ability to generate meaning from its interactions with the world. 
   Conversely, generating meaning without autonomy would be pointless, as the agent would have no capacity to act on that meaning.

8. Implications for AGI:
   The authors believe that this theory of meaning generation can pave the way for more advanced AGI systems with enhanced autonomy and generality. 
   By grounding meaning in causal models, goals, and real-time decision-making, AGI systems could achieve a higher level of understanding and adaptability.

9. Conclusion:
   The paper presents a novel theory of meaning generation that integrates causal reasoning, goal management, and real-time decision-making in autonomous agents. 
   The authors propose that this framework is essential for developing AGI systems that can operate autonomously and generate meaning in a manner similar to natural intelligence. 
   The theory bridges the gap between philosophical discussions of meaning and practical considerations in the design of intelligent systems, 
   offering a path toward more sophisticated and autonomous AI.
