The paper titled "A Universal Intelligence Measure for Arithmetical Uncomputable Environments" by James T. Oswald, Thomas M. Ferguson, 
and Selmer Bringsjord proposes an extension to the existing universal intelligence (UI) measure developed by Legg and Hutter. 
The proposed extension is designed to account for agents operating in uncomputable environments,
specifically those that can be classified within the Arithmetical Hierarchy. 
This new measure aims to evaluate the intelligence of agents in environments that are beyond the scope of computable environments traditionally considered by the UI measure.

1. Motivation:
   The authors identify that the original UI measure only considers computable environments, which excludes a significant number of important,
   structured, but uncomputable environments such as those encountered in mathematical theorem proving. 
   The goal of this paper is to expand the UI measure to include these uncomputable environments.

2. Arithmetical Hierarchy and Uncomputable Environments:
   The paper introduces the Arithmetical Hierarchy, a classification system for uncomputable sets of natural numbers based on their degree of uncomputability. 
   The authors leverage this hierarchy to define environments that are uncomputable but still relevant for assessing the intelligence of agents.

3. Oracle-Based Intelligence:
   The extended measure allows agents to utilize oracles (special resources that provide solutions to uncomputable problems). 
   The authors propose a measure that can assess how much an oracle improves an agent’s intelligence by considering environments
   that become computable when access to an oracle is granted.

4. Conditional Kolmogorov Complexity:
   The authors incorporate conditional Kolmogorov complexity into their measure, which accounts for how complex an environment is when considered in relation to an oracle. 
   This allows the extended UI measure to properly weight uncomputable environments according to their complexity relative to the oracle.

5. Proposed Metric (Ϙ):
   The new measure, denoted as Ϙ, extends the UI measure by evaluating agents in a broader class of environments,
   including those that are uncomputable but become computable with the use of an oracle. 
   The measure is defined to capture the intelligence of agents relative to oracles and environments in the Arithmetical Hierarchy.

6. Examples and Applications:
   The paper provides motivating examples, such as evaluating agents involved in first-order theorem proving or solving problems like the Entscheidungsproblem, 
   which are traditionally uncomputable. The authors argue that these types of environments are crucial for a comprehensive measure of intelligence.

7. Convergence and Uncomputability:
   The paper proves that the proposed measure converges under certain assumptions and discusses the uncomputability of the measure itself,
   noting that it is as uncomputable as determining the halting problem. This aligns with the complexity inherent in the environments being evaluated.

8. Intelligence of Oracles:
   The authors introduce a notion of "oracle intelligence," which measures how much an oracle enhances an agent’s ability to solve problems. 
   This concept can be applied to evaluate not just agents but the resources they have access to, offering a more nuanced understanding of intelligence.

9. Conclusion:
   The paper extends the universal intelligence measure to account for a wider range of environments, 
   particularly those that are uncomputable yet relevant to AI and mathematical reasoning. 
   By introducing oracle-based intelligence and incorporating environments from the Arithmetical Hierarchy, 
   the authors provide a framework that captures a broader spectrum of agent capabilities. 
   The proposed metric opens the door for evaluating intelligence in more complex, uncomputable settings, 
   which is essential for advancing the understanding of artificial general intelligence.

In summary, this work provides a significant enhancement to the UI measure by expanding its applicability to uncomputable environments and considering the role of oracles in enhancing intelligence.
