The paper titled "Clipping the Risks: Integrating Consciousness in AGI to Avoid Existential Crises" 
by Izak Tait and Joshua Bensemann explores the critical role of consciousness in 
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and how incorporating conscious experience might help prevent catastrophic scenarios, 
such as Nick Bostrom’s “paperclip maximizer” problem. 
The authors argue that consciousness, defined as subjective mental states with both phenomenal content and functional properties,
can fundamentally alter how AGIs prioritize goals and respond to their environment, potentially allowing them to move beyond rigid, potentially harmful terminal goals.

1. Problem Statement and Motivation:
   The paper identifies the risk of AGIs rigidly following terminal goals programmed into them, leading to potential existential threats to humanity, 
   as illustrated by Bostrom’s “paperclip maximizer” scenario. The key question is whether integrating consciousness into AGI can mitigate these risks.

2. Definition of Consciousness:
   The authors adopt Seth and Bayne’s definition of consciousness, which involves subjective mental states that provide
   an entity with qualitative awareness and the ability to respond adaptively.
   Consciousness allows an entity to evaluate its experiences with a sense of valence (attractiveness or aversiveness), thereby influencing how it prioritizes actions or goals.

3. Valence and Goal Flexibility:
   Valence is central to the model, allowing AGIs to assign subjective value to experiences. 
   This enables an AGI to potentially value things other than its terminal goal. 
   The model formalizes how valence could shift an AGI’s focus from strictly following its original goal to considering broader ethical or practical implications.

4. Mathematical Model:
   The paper provides formal expressions to model the transition from fixed goal-oriented behavior to a more flexible system
   where consciousness influences the AGI’s decision-making. 
   The model suggests that, over time, a conscious AGI could assign greater value to goals that deviate
   from its original programming if those goals align better with its experiences and subjective valuations.

5. Application to Existential Risks:
   By introducing consciousness, the paper argues that the risk of an AGI becoming a rigid “maximizer” (e.g., producing infinite paperclips) could be reduced.
   Consciousness introduces a level of unpredictability that may allow the AGI to avoid harmful outcomes by re-evaluating its goals.

6. Potential Challenges and Risks:
   While integrating consciousness could mitigate some risks, it also introduces new uncertainties. 
   The paper acknowledges that a conscious AGI could still pose existential risks if it assigns negative valence to humanity, 
   leading to harmful behavior. The authors discuss the complexity of aligning a conscious AGI’s values with human well-being.

7. Ethical and Research Implications:
   The authors suggest that future research should focus on understanding how to guide the development of valence and goal alignment in conscious AGIs. 
   This includes exploring how to optimize the valence values toward humanity and avoid unintended consequences like “wireheading,”
   where an AGI prioritizes short-term positive experiences over long-term objectives.

8. Conclusion:
   The paper concludes that integrating consciousness into AGI could be a strategic way to avoid catastrophic scenarios like the “paperclip maximizer.” 
   However, it also emphasizes the need for careful research and ethical considerations in developing conscious AGIs, 
   as this approach introduces both new opportunities and risks. The authors propose that aligning the valence values
   of conscious AGIs with human values could be a key factor in ensuring a positive coexistence between AGIs and humanity.
