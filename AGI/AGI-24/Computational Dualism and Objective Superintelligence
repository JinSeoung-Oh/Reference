The paper titled "Computational Dualism and Objective Superintelligence" by Michael Timothy Bennett discusses a critical issue
in the way we conceptualize artificial intelligence (AI) and superintelligence. 
The author identifies and critiques "computational dualism," where AI is treated as separate software interacting with hardware, 
drawing an analogy to Descartes' mind-body dualism. 
Bennett argues that this dualistic thinking limits our understanding of AI and suggests an alternative approach based on enactivism and pancomputationalism.

1. Computational Dualism:
   The author defines computational dualism as the flawed assumption that software (like AI) can be understood as distinct from hardware. 
   This dualism mirrors Descartes’ mind-body distinction, where software is akin to the mind and hardware to the body.
   The paper argues that AI’s behavior cannot be fully understood without considering the hardware on which it runs.

2. Enactivism and Pancomputationalism:
   As an alternative to computational dualism, the paper introduces enactivism and pancomputationalism. 
   Enactivism suggests that cognition is inseparable from the environment, meaning that intelligence is not just a property
   of software but is enacted through interactions with the environment. 
   Pancomputationalism posits that everything can be understood as part of a computational system, where there is no clear distinction between software and hardware.

3. Objective Intelligence:
   The author proposes that intelligence should be understood as the ability to generalize, identify causes, and adapt to unforeseen circumstances. 
   This understanding moves away from treating intelligence as solely a property of predictive models or software algorithms.

4. Limits of Intelligence:
   The paper discusses how intelligence is often equated with efficient learning and adaptation, but it highlights that there are inherent limits
   to what even the most intelligent systems can achieve. By formalizing intelligence in the context of pancomputationalism, 
   the author argues that there are objective upper bounds on intelligent behavior. 
   This conclusion suggests that while AGI might be safer than expected, it is also likely to be more limited than traditionally theorized.

5. Implications for AI Safety and Development:
   The analysis implies that AGI systems, constrained by their physical embodiment and computational resources, 
   will not have the unrestricted superintelligent capabilities often portrayed in speculative scenarios. 
   Understanding the limitations of intelligence through the lens of enactivism and computational realism can lead to more realistic expectations
   for AI safety and the development of AGI.

6. Conclusion:
   The paper challenges the traditional notion of AI as disembodied software capable of superintelligence, proposing a shift toward understanding AI as an embodied,
   environment-dependent process. By rejecting computational dualism and adopting a more holistic view, 
   we can better understand the realistic capabilities and limitations of AI systems. 
   The implications of this shift suggest that while AGI might be intelligent, it will be safer and less omnipotent than previously feared.
