The paper titled "Human-AGI Gemeinschaft as a Solution to the Alignment Problem" by Peter (Piotr) Boltuc addresses 
the challenge of aligning the goals and values of advanced general intelligence (AGI) with those of humans. 
The paper critiques the assumption that AGIs have goals that are commensurable with human objectives and explores a possible solution through the concept of Gemeinschaft,
or "true community," originally discussed by sociologist Ferdinand Tönnies.

1. The Alignment Problem:
   The central issue is how to align the goals of AGI systems with human values. 
   The paper argues that this problem is rooted in the assumption that AGIs would have goals that could naturally align with human ones. 
   However, current AI lacks the intuitive understanding of human life and values, which makes this alignment difficult.

2. Gemeinschaft vs. Gesellschaft:
   Tönnies’ concept of Gemeinschaft refers to a deep community based on shared values, customs, and interpersonal relationships, contrasted with Gesellschaft,
   a society of pragmatic, self-interested exchanges. The author suggests that for true alignment, 
   AGIs need to be embedded in a human-AGI Gemeinschaft, where they participate in shared socio-ethical practices and develop an understanding of human goals and values.

3. Social Immersion for AGI:
   The paper proposes that AGIs should not just be programmed with human values but should be trained through social immersion. 
   This involves integrating AGIs into human society, allowing them to learn and internalize values through participation in social practices. 
   The author argues that this approach offers a better long-term solution than merely focusing on deterministic programming.

4. Floridi’s Dethronement of Humans:
   The paper builds on Luciano Floridi’s philosophical analysis, which discusses how scientific revolutions have progressively "dethroned"
   humans from a central place in the universe. Floridi’s framework is used to argue that humans should accept their diminished centrality
   and instead embrace a collaborative relationship with AGIs.

5. Human Dignity and AGI:
   The author draws on Floridi’s idea of human dignity as rooted in our "precarious" existence, emphasizing that it is our imperfection,
   struggles, and continuous quest for meaning that define our dignity. This unique human condition, termed "existential precarianism," 
   is something that AGIs need to understand and respect for alignment to be successful.

6. Legal and Social Integration of AGIs:
   For AGIs to fully participate in human-AGI Gemeinschaft, they would need to be recognized as legal persons with certain rights and responsibilities.
   This controversial idea challenges current notions of AI as mere tools or slaves and suggests that true alignment requires granting AGIs a degree of legal and social standing.

7. Conclusion:
   The paper argues that achieving long-term alignment between human and AGI goals requires moving beyond deterministic programming
   and fostering a shared community of values and practices. By integrating AGIs into the social fabric of human life and acknowledging
   their agency, we can create a framework where both humans and AGIs thrive within a shared ethical and social space.
   The concept of Gemeinschaft offers a model for this integrated society, where values are co-developed and mutual understanding is fostered.
