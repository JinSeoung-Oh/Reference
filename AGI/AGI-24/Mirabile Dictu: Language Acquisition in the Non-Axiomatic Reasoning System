Non-Axiomatic Reasoning System (NARS), could develop human-like language acquisition capabilities. 
The main focus is on enabling agents within the NARS framework to evolve and use language as a tool for communication,
akin to how humans develop language.

1. Human-Like Language as a Path to AGI:
   The author argues that achieving true AGI requires systems capable of developing, evolving, and utilizing novel languages. 
   This involves not just mimicking human language patterns but enabling systems to acquire language internally based on their experiences and interactions.

2. Limitations of Current Language Models:
   While large language models (LLMs) have made impressive strides in language processing, they treat language as a static proxy for intelligence.
   The paper suggests that this approach lacks the flexibility and adaptability of human-like language acquisition.

3. NARS as a Candidate for AGI:
   NARS operates under the assumption of insufficient knowledge and resources (AIKR), which mirrors the constraints faced by human cognition.
   The system’s representative language, Narsese, uses term logic to model reasoning and learning. 
   Narsese serves as the foundation for developing more complex language capabilities within NARS.

4. Language Acquisition in NARS:
   The paper hypothesizes how a community of NARS agents could acquire language.
   It suggests that agents equipped with sensors and basic communication abilities would develop internal concepts and relate them to external symbols (e.g., pictograms), 
   similar to how early humans evolved language. Over time, agents could establish shared meanings and syntaxes through repeated social interactions.

5. Implementing Language Features:
   The author aligns NARS’s capabilities with Hockett’s design features of human language (e.g., displacement, productivity, cultural transmission). 
   The paper details how these features could be modeled within NARS, demonstrating the system’s potential to support complex language acquisition.

6. Challenges and Future Work:
   The paper acknowledges the challenges in making this approach practical, given the popularity of LLMs. 
   However, it highlights the potential benefits, such as improved adaptability in unknown environments (e.g., space exploration) 
   and modeling cognitive conditions related to language disorders.

7. Conclusion:
   The paper concludes that NARS has the necessary components to develop language capabilities similar to human communication. 
   It suggests future work involving simulated environments where a population of NARS agents could interact, leading to the emergence of novel communication forms.

In summary, the paper presents an alternative approach to AGI, focusing on the natural evolution of language within intelligent systems
rather than relying solely on pre-trained language models.
