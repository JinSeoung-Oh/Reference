The pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) requires moving
beyond the limitations of current Deep Learning (DL) techniques. 
Deep Symbolics (DS) represents this next step by integrating the brain's symbolic capabilities into AI systems. 
Unlike DL, which relies on statistical models, DS focuses on the brain’s ability to handle and manipulate symbols,
thus addressing the shortcomings of DL in achieving AGI.

1. The Limitations of Deep Learning
   Deep Learning has shown impressive results, particularly since its breakthrough in 2012 with ImageNet.
   However, DL models, which include Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), face significant challenges:

   -1. Black-Box Problem
       DL models operate as black boxes, making their decision-making processes opaque and difficult to explain.
   -2. Static Learning
       DL systems typically require a training phase followed by an operational phase, limiting their ability 
       to learn continuously or adapt in real-time.
   -3. Lack of Symbolic Reasoning
       DL models are primarily statistical and lack the symbolic reasoning capabilities necessary for 
       true understanding and manipulation of complex concepts.

2. Introduction to Patom Theory
   Patom Theory (PT) forms the foundation of Deep Symbolics.
   PT was developed to explain the brain's functioning by focusing on evolutionary capabilities and 
   the effects of brain damage rather than on the anatomical details of neurons.
   It proposes that the brain operates by storing, matching, and using hierarchical, bidirectional linkset patterns.

   -1. Key Concepts of Patom Theory
       -1) Bidirectional Patterns
           Brain regions can send and receive signals, allowing for feedback and more dynamic processing.
       -2) Hierarchical Structure
           Information is processed in layers, with higher-level concepts building upon lower-level patterns.
       -3) Linkset Patterns
           Instead of isolated data points, the brain uses interconnected patterns, 
           enabling more efficient and context-aware processing.

3. Emulating Brain Functions with Deep Symbolics
   Deep Symbolics aims to emulate the brain’s symbolic capabilities more closely than DL.

   -1. Symbolic Knowledge Representation
       Unlike DL's statistical approach, DS uses predefined symbols and relationships to represent knowledge, 
       akin to how dictionaries link words to their meanings.
   -2. Continuous Learning
       DS systems can learn and update their knowledge in real-time, similar to how humans learn continuously.
   -3. Hierarchical and Contextual Processing
       DS systems process information hierarchically and contextually, integrating various sensory inputs into a cohesive understanding.

4. Practical Example: Throwing a Ball
   To understand how brains work, consider the task of throwing a ball. 
   This involves a complex sequence of neurons firing to control muscles, with sensory feedback adjusting the action in real-time. 
   DS systems aim to replicate this by:

   -1. Pattern Recognition and Matching
       Recognizing and matching sensory inputs to control outputs effectively.
   -2. Learning on the Fly
       Continuously improving the action based on feedback, much like a human adjusts their throw with practice.

5. Deep Symbolics in Action
   -1. High-Level Brain Model
       In DS, sensory inputs (e.g., vision and hearing) are matched with stored patterns and combined into multisensory patterns.
       This is illustrated in Diagram 2, where sensory inputs are processed in dedicated areas and linked to other regions
       for comprehensive understanding.

   Example of Learning
   Consider the sentence "I saw her duck!" DS systems can handle this ambiguity by asking clarifying questions, 
   such as "She ducked?" to resolve the meaning accurately, demonstrating a level of contextual understanding absent in DL systems.

6. Advantages of Deep Symbolics
   -1. Explainability
       DS provides interpretable results, unlike the black-box nature of DL.
   -2. Real-Time Adaptation
       DS can learn and adapt continuously, reflecting human learning processes.
   -3. Symbolic Reasoning
       By using symbols, DS can handle complex concepts and relationships more effectively.

7. Conclusion
   Deep Symbolics offers a promising path towards AGI by integrating symbolic reasoning with continuous learning and hierarchical processing.
   By addressing the limitations of Deep Learning, DS aligns more closely with the brain's functioning, 
   potentially leading to more advanced and capable AI systems.
