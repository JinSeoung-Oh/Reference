The text you've provided discusses a novel approach to understanding how the brain, and potentially future Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) systems, 
might handle tasks like arithmetic and language processing without relying on traditional computation. 
This approach, called Pattern-Based Arithmetic, emphasizes pattern matching over computational operations.

1. Pattern Matching: A Non-Computational Approach
   Why Pattern Matching Over Computation?
   The central argument is that the brain does not perform arithmetic or process language through computation as a digital computer does. 
   Instead, it recognizes and matches patterns stored from prior learning. This perspective stems from semiotics, 
   the study of signs and symbols as elements of communicative behavior.

   -1. Semiotics and Pattern Recognition:
       -1) Semiotics: The brain recognizes input as signs, which are matched with stored patterns that include their meanings. 
                      For example, when you see the numeral "2," your brain retrieves the concept of "two" based on prior knowledge.
       -2) Pattern Matching: After the brain has learned something, like how to add numbers, it no longer computes the addition each time it sees the numbers "2" and "3."
                             Instead, it recognizes the pattern "2 + 3" and recalls the result "5" from memory.

2. The Learning Process According to Patom Theory
   - Diagram 1: Learning to Add Without Computation
     -1) Step I: The brain receives sensory input, such as seeing the numeral "2."
     -2) Step II: The brain recognizes this as a sign and matches it with stored patterns.
     -3) Step III-IV: It links the sign to its meaning (e.g., "2" means two) and categorizes it (e.g., "2" is a number).
     -4) Step V-VII: Through repeated exposure, the brain develops emergent patterns like "number + number,"
                     which it can later use without needing to perform any actual computation.

3. Application to AGI: Moving Beyond Computation
   - Challenges in AGI Development
     The text argues that one reason AGI hasn't progressed as much as hoped is due to reliance on computational paradigms that don't align with how the human brain works.
     To advance, AGI should focus on symbolic solutions and pattern recognition, as illustrated by Patom Theory.

    - Role of RRG (Role and Reference Grammar):
      The RRG linguistic model is highlighted as a framework that can help understand how languages work at a fundamental level,
      which is crucial for both natural language processing (NLP) and understanding arithmetic as pattern-based rather than computational tasks.

4. Practical Examples: Arithmetic Without Computation
   - Diagram 2: How Arithmetic Works in Patom Theory:
     The brain stores patterns, and when faced with an arithmetic problem like "4 + 5 = 9," it doesn't compute the answer from scratch. 
     Instead, it matches the pattern of "number + number" with stored knowledge.
     The process is entirely based on recognizing and recalling patterns rather than performing calculations.

    - Error Correction and Larger Numbers:
      -1) Error Correction
          The brain uses pattern recognition to ensure consistency and correctness. 
          For instance, it would recognize that "123 + cat =" doesn't make sense because "cat" isn't a number.
      -2) Adding Larger Numbers
          Even with more complex arithmetic, the brain relies on the same pattern-matching processes. Larger numbers don't change the fundamental approach.

5. Conclusion: Emphasizing Pattern Matching for AGI
   The text concludes by reinforcing the idea that brains do not need to compute in the traditional sense.
   Instead, they rely on a sophisticated system of pattern matching, which could inspire new approaches to developing AGI. 
   This non-computational approach could lead to more human-like intelligence in machines, emphasizing learning and pattern recognition over raw computation.

In essence, Pattern-Based Arithmetic and Patom Theory offer a paradigm shift from computation to pattern recognition, 
suggesting that by emulating the brain's pattern-matching abilities, we might overcome some of the current limitations in AI and AGI development.
