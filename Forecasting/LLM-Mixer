Time series forecasting involves predicting future values based on historical data, which is particularly valuable in fields like finance and risk management. 
However, forecasting is challenging due to the complex, nonlinear, and multivariate characteristics of real-world data. 
Traditional models often struggle to capture both short-term fluctuations and long-term trends simultaneously.

1. LLMs in Time Series
   The success of Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 has prompted researchers to apply LLMs to various domains, including time series forecasting. 
   LLMs are attractive for time series forecasting because of their capabilities in few-shot and zero-shot learning, knowledge integration, and reasoning over complex patterns. 
   However, time series data differs significantly from the discrete tokens that LLMs typically handle, presenting new challenges.

   - Solution: LLM-Mixer
     LLM-Mixer is an approach that adapts LLMs for time series forecasting by decomposing data into multiple temporal resolutions. 
     This technique enables the LLM to model complex patterns across various time scales, enhancing its ability to capture both short- and long-term dependencies.

2. LLM-Mixer Architecture
   -1. Data Downsampling and Embedding
       Time series data is downsampled into multiple resolutions to capture short-term fluctuations and long-term trends. 
       These representations are enriched with three types of embeddings:

      -a. Token embeddings: Obtained through 1D convolutions to represent the raw data values.
      -b. Temporal embeddings: Encode information like day, week, or month to represent seasonal or periodic patterns.
      -c. Positional embeddings: Encodes sequence positions, helping the model understand the order of data points.

3. Past-Decomposable-Mixing (PDM) Module
   The PDM module processes the multiscale data representations, separating them into trend and seasonal components for each temporal resolution.
    This targeted decomposition enables the model to handle complex time series with different frequencies and amplitudes more effectively.

4. Pre-trained LLM Processing
   The multiscale data, accompanied by a task-specific prompt, is fed into a frozen pre-trained LLM. 
   The LLM leverages its pretrained knowledge and the structured multiscale input to generate forecasts. 
   The model does not require retraining on the specific time series, making it adaptable across datasets.

5. Forecast Generation
   A trainable decoder (simple linear transformation) is applied to the LLM's final hidden layer to produce the forecast for the next set of time steps, 
   completing the LLM-Mixer pipeline.

6. Evaluation and Results
   -1. Datasets
       LLM-Mixer is evaluated on standard time series benchmarks for both long-term and short-term forecasting:

   Long-term forecasting: Includes ETT (ETTh1, ETTh2, ETTm1, ETTm2), Weather, Electricity, and Traffic datasets.
   Short-term forecasting: Includes PeMS (PEMS03, PEMS04, PEMS07, PEMS08) traffic datasets.

7. Performance Metrics
   Performance is measured using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), where lower values indicate better accuracy.

8. Results
   -1. Long-term Multivariate Forecasting:
       LLM-Mixer outperforms models like TIME-LLM, TimeMixer, and PatchTST on the ETTh1, ETTh2, and Electricity datasets, 
       achieving low MSE and MAE values across forecasting horizons (96, 192, 384, and 720 time steps).
   -2. Short-term Multivariate Forecasting:
       Consistently achieves low MSE and MAE across PeMS datasets, including PEMS03, PEMS04, and PEMS07. On PEMS08, it outperforms models like iTransformer and DLinear, 
       capturing essential short-term dynamics effectively.
   -3. Long-term Univariate Forecasting:
       On the ETT benchmark, LLM-Mixer achieves the lowest MSE and MAE values across datasets, outperforming methods like Linear, NLinear, and FEDformer.

9. Summary
   LLM-Mixer leverages multiscale decomposition and LLM-based forecasting to achieve competitive accuracy in time series forecasting. 
   By capturing both short- and long-term dependencies, LLM-Mixer addresses the inherent challenges of multiscale time series data, 
   showing that LLMs can be adapted for tasks beyond natural language.
