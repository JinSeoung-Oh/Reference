What is Generative AI
1. GenAI is a type of AI that creates new content based on what it has learned from exsting content
2. The process of learning from existing content is called training and results in the creation of a statistical model
3. When given a prompt, GenAI uses this statistical model to predict what an expected response might be-and this generates new content

Two type(upper level)
1. Gen language models : Generative language models learn abot patterns in language through training data.
Then, given some text, they predict what comes next...

2. Gen Image models : Generative image models produce new images using tech like diffusion.
Then, given a promot or related imagery, they transform random noise into images or generate images from prompts.

Type of models
1. text-to-text : take a natural laguage input and produce text optput. These modles are trained to learn the mapping between a pair of texts
2. text-to-image : trained on a large set of images, each captioned with a short text desription
3. text-to-video & text-to-3D : aim to generate a video representation from text input
                                text-to-3d models generate three-dimensional object that correspond to a user's text description
4. text-to-task : trained to perform a specific task or action based on text input
                  ex. answering a question, performing a search, making a prediction etc


*** Responsible AI 
The goal of responsible AI is to employ AI in a safe, trustworthy and ethical fashion. Using AI responsibly should increase transparency and help reduce issues such as AI bias
