## Emu
Emu is based on an AI technique called “diffusion models”. 
Specifically, Emu uses a “latent diffusion model,” which means it first encodes the text prompt into
a latent representation before going through the diffusion process to generate the image
And Emu is faster then Midjourney and Dall-E3

Meta compared Emu to the state-of-the-art SDXL1.0 model and found that Emu is preferred 
68.4% of the time on visual appeal on the standard PartiPrompts benchmark and 71.3% on their Open User Input benchmark
