Lumiere, a novel text-to-video diffusion model. Lumiere stands out for its ability to synthesize videos with realistic, diverse, and coherent motion

1. Model Architecture
   Lumiere employs a Space-Time U-Net (STUnet) architecture, which performs both spatial and temporal downsampling and upsampling in a single pass. 
  This approach helps maintain global temporal consistency and differs from traditional models that create keyframes and then add details.

2. Diffusion Probabilistic Models
   Lumiere uses Diffusion Probabilistic Models for video generation, approximating a data distribution 
   through denoising steps, starting from Gaussian noise and gradually refining it.

3. Base Model and Super-Resolution
   The framework includes a base model for generating low-resolution video clips and 
   a spatial super-resolution model for upscaling to high resolution.

4. Temporal Attention
   The STUnet incorporates temporal blocks with spatial resizing modules, temporal convolutions, and attention. 
   Temporal attention is used at the coarsest resolution to manage computational demands.

5. Multidiffusion for Super-Resolution
   Lumiere uses Multidiffusion to handle memory constraints and avoid temporal artifacts during spatial super-resolution. 
   This involves splitting the video into overlapping segments, processing each with Single Shot Reconstruction (SSR), and then combining them.

6. Applications: Lumiere has various applications, including:
   -1. Stylized Generation: Using a technique inspired by GAN-based interpolation, Lumiere blends T2I weights with original weights 
       to achieve distinct motion characteristics in generated videos, such as watercolor painting or line drawing styles.
   -2. Conditional Generation: Lumiere can generate videos based on additional input signals, such as a noisy video, a conditioning video or image, 
       or a binary mask. Applications include Image-to-Video, inpainting, and cinemagraphs.

Overall, Lumiere achieves state-of-the-art results in text-to-video generation and is adaptable for content creation and video editing tasks.
