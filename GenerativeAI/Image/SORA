** Prior knowledge ** 
The Vision Transformer stands out as a significant advancement in video generation models, particularly compared to previous methods like the 3D UNet.

1. Global Understanding of Video
   Unlike the 3D UNet, where the transformer operates within the UNet and lacks a holistic view of the video, 
   the Vision Transformer allows transformers to globally dominate video generation. 
   This means that transformers can consider the entire video as a sequence, similar to how language models process text.

2. Sequence Representation
   The Vision Transformer represents a video as a sequence of tokens, similar to how language models tokenize text. 
   Each token represents a small piece of the video data.

3. Transformer Application
   Once the video is encoded into a token sequence, the Vision Transformer applies multiple layers of transformers to process and understand the video data. 
   This mechanism aligns well with the principles of language models, making it straightforward and effective.

4. Simplicity and Scalability
   The design of the Vision Transformer is simple yet powerful, aligning with OpenAI's approach of favoring simplicity and scalability over complex and fancy methods. 
   By focusing on scaling with vast amounts of training data rather than intricate model structures, the Vision Transformer achieves impressive results.

5. Enhanced Learning Capabilities
   Compared to previous methods like the 3D UNet, the Vision Transformer allows for greater focus on learning patterns of motion imagery. 
   This enables the model to handle greater movement amplitude and longer video lengths, addressing challenges faced by previous video generation models.

Overall, the Vision Transformer represents a significant leap forward in video generation models,
offering a simple yet effective approach that aligns with the principles of language models while addressing key limitations of previous methods. 
Its ability to globally understand videos and efficiently learn motion patterns contributes to its outstanding performance in video generation tasks.
