1. Centrality & Similarity
   Graph analysis leverages the tools and techniques developed in graph theory to gain insights and make informed decisions in different domains, 
   such as social networks, transportation networks, computer networks, biology, and many others.

   Centrality and similarity are two core concepts in graph analysis. You might have heard of the PageRank algorithm used by Google Search. 
   PageRank is a centrality algorithm used to measure the importance or influence of nodes in a network, particularly in web page ranking and hyperlink analysis. 
   It assigns a numerical score to each node based on the number and quality of incoming links, helping identify key nodes in a network.

   Betweenness centrality is another measure of centrality. 
   The node with the highest betweenness centrality acts as the most important bridge among all the other nodes. 
   To find the betweenness centrality of a node, we need to look at all the pairs of nodes and see how many times each node appears on the shortest path 
   between two other nodes. The node who appears on the most shortest paths is the one with the highest betweenness centrality.


2. Graph with nodes and betweenness centrality for every node. 
   In social networks or real-world systems, nodes (e.g. people, places, or entities) with high betweenness centrality play a crucial role 
   in maintaining communication and connections between different parts of the network. 
   They act as important mediators, ensuring efficient communication and keeping the network connected.

   It can also be useful to find out how similar certain nodes are. 
   This can be done by calculating node similarity. Jaccard Similarity is often used for unweighted graphs. 
   It calculates the similarity between two nodes based on the number of common neighbors they share, divided by the total number of unique neighbors they have.

Node similarity is used in collaborative filtering techniques to recommend items to users based on the similarity of their preferences with other users. 
It can also be used to predict missing or future links in a network or for detecting clusters and communities.
