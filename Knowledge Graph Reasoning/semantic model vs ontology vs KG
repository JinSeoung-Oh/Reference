The hierarchy and relationship between semantic models, ontologies, and knowledge graphs, aiming 
to provide clarity and establish a common understanding of these terms within the field.

1. Ontologies:
   -1. Defined as formal descriptions of concepts and relationships within a domain, ontologies serve as structural 
       frameworks for organizing information and knowledge representation.
   -2. Object Role Modeling (ORM) diagrams are used to represent ontologies, capturing formal relationships 
       between entities and explicit data constraints.
   -3. ORM is suitable for knowledge graph ontologies due to its ability to capture constraints and diagram core graph concepts.
   -4. Ontologies are not tied to specific implementation paradigms and can be realized as knowledge graphs 
       using various technologies such as RDF, LPG, Relational Knowledge Graph (RKG), etc.

2. Semantic Models:
   -1. Semantic models organize data to reflect the basic meaning of data items and their relationships.
   -2. They represent the largest scale representation of a domain, capturing business terms, relationships, and data semantics.
   -3. Semantic models serve as dictionaries of the domain, providing vocabulary that ontologies can utilize.
   -4. Each ontology within a semantic model represents a subset of the domain and follows the semantics defined by the semantic model.
   -5. Semantic models facilitate understanding and communication across different parts of an enterprise, 
       enabling separate domains to speak a common language.

3. Knowledge Graphs:
   -1. Knowledge graphs are not explicitly defined in the text, but they are mentioned as the implementation of ontologies.
   -2. They are compared to buildings, where the ontology serves as the architectural plan guiding the construction of the knowledge graph.
   -3. Knowledge graphs should adhere to the complete description provided by the ontology, ensuring that the graph accurately represents the domain.
   -4. Flexible ontologies are agnostic to implementation choices, allowing knowledge graphs to adapt and extend 
       with the data they ingest without disrupting decision-making processes.

Overall, the text emphasizes the importance of clear definitions and understanding of semantic models, ontologies, and knowledge graphs 
in order to facilitate effective communication and knowledge representation within organizations.
