## The Evolution from Kosmos 1 to Kosmos 2
Kosmos 2 introduces a groundbreaking feature called grounding. 
This feature enables the AI to interact with images more accurately and meaningfully by creating hyperlinks 
between image elements and their descriptions.

With grounding, Kosmos 2 can identify individual objects in an image and create hyperlinks to their descriptions, 
enabling users to easily navigate through the various elements present.
This level of granularity in image analysis enhances the AI’s ability to interpret and describe complex scenes with greater accuracy.

## Training 
During the training process, Kosmos 2 was exposed to a diverse set of image-text pairs, 
enabling it to learn the correlations between visual content and textual descriptions

In addition to image understanding, Kosmos 2 has also been trained to excel in processing text. 
The large text corpus used for training allowed Kosmos 2 to develop a deep understanding of language patterns, grammar, and semantics. 

## Capabilities of Kosmos 2
One of the most remarkable capabilities of Kosmos 2 is its ability to answer questions about specific regions within images

-Grounded Picture Captioning
Kosmos 2 offers practical applications in grounded picture captioning, a task that involves generating textual descriptions for images. 
It utilizes a multimodal approach, combining visual and textual information, to generate accurate and contextually relevant captions

-Grounded Visual Question Answering
GVQA involves answering questions about images by understanding both the visual content and the textual context of the questions. 
Kosmos 2’s multimodal AI capabilities enable it to accurately interpret the contents of images and provide meaningful answers to questions related to them

- *Grounded Visual Reasoning(important)
Kosmos 2’s practical applications extend to grounded visual reasoning, 
which involves performing logical reasoning tasks based on visual information.

ex) 
In fields such as robotics and automation, Kosmos 2’s grounded visual reasoning can be utilized to develop AI-powered robots
that can navigate and interact with their environment effectively.
For example, a robot equipped with Kosmos 2 can analyze visual inputs from its surroundings,
apply reasoning to understand the layout of a room, and make intelligent decisions on navigation paths or object manipulation
