### Plz check given link for recommandation

1. Autogen
   AutoGen is the most popular and the earliest framework in the space by Microsoft, more suitable for software development tasks

   -1. Features
       - It majorly involves two agents, the User and the Assistant.
       - User-Agent & Assistant-Agent Interaction: In Autogen’s user-assistant agent model, the User Agent can provide prompts or requirements, 
         while the Assistant Agent generates and executes the code.
       - The Assistant Agent handles not just code generation but also the execution, giving results back to the user or other agents in the setup.
       - Specializes in multi-agent orchestration for code tasks but can handle other tasks as well.
       - Human guidance can be provided in between the interactions.
       - Strong community support from Microsoft.

   -2. Limitations
       - Not intuitive enough, and not suitable for non-programmers.
       - A complicated setup, especially with local LLMs; requires a proxy server.
       - If not a software development task, can be pretty mediocre

2. CrewAI
   CrewAI is usually the go-to choice for folks to build a quick demo for any Multi AI Agent task given it's very intuitive and easy to set up.

    -1. Features
        - Very intuitive, and primarily relies on prompt writing.
        - Creating new agents and adding to the ecosystem is very easy. You can create 100s of agents in minutes
        - Easy to use for non-technical users.
        - Works well with most LLM providers and local LLMs, thanks to LangChain integration.

    -2. Limitations:
        - Limited flexibility and customization.
        - Suitable for basic use cases and not ideal for complex programming tasks.
        - There are some bugs during interactions between agents.
        - Community support is limited

3. Langraph
   My personal favourite, LangGraph can be used for any Multi-AI Agent tasks and provides a lot of flexibility.

   -1. Features
       - Built on top of LangChain; based on the idea of Directed Cyclic Graph.
       - It's not just a multi-AI agent framework, but a lot more.
       - Very flexible and customizable, supporting nearly any multi-agent orchestration application.
       - It is an extension of LangChain, hence got great community support.
       - Works well with open-sourced LLMs and any API

   -2. Limitations:
       - Lacks thorough documentation.
       - Not user-friendly for non-programmers or beginner programmers.
       - Requires decent programming skills, particularly in understanding graphs and logic flows.

4. OpenAI Swarm
   OpenAI recently released Swarm, and I must say, it’s the easiest Multi-AI agent framework out there if you wish to get started

   -1. Features
       - Suitable for newbies in Multi-AI Agent
       - The major focus is on simplifying “Agent creation” and context switching between agents (called Handoffs).
       - Creating a short demo is super easy

   -2. Limitations
       - Doesn’t support LLMs other than OpenAI API
       - Not good for production deployments
       - Not flexible enough.
       - Community support is poor. You can't even raise issues on Git Hub
  
5. Magentic-One
   The latest addition to this list is Magentic-One by Microsoft (their 2nd framework) which also, is an attempt to simplify their existing AutoGen framework

   -1. Features
       - Similar to Swarm, this is suitable for non-programmers and easy to run
       - Comes with a default pack of 5 agents, one manager agent and other 4 being: WebSurfer navigates and interacts with webpages through a browser, 
         FileSurfer manages and navigates local files, Coder focuses on writing and analyzing code, 
         and ComputerTerminal provides console access for running programs and installing libraries.
       - Built on top of AutoGen, and is more of a generalist framework.
       - Includes AutoGenBench, a tool specific for analysing agent performance.

   -2. Limitations
       - Support for open-source LLMs is complicated
       - Not flexible enough; appears more like an application rather than a framework to me
       - Documentation and community support is nil as of now
