Agent K v1.0: Autonomous Data Science Agent

Agent K v1.0 is an autonomous agent designed to tackle the entire data science lifecycle using experience-based learning, 
rather than traditional fine-tuning or backpropagation. 
It leverages a structured reasoning framework with memory-based learning to dynamically adapt and optimize its performance.

1. Key Features
   -1. Reasoning by Experience
       -a. Utilizes internal working memory and an external long-term memory database to adapt based on prior tasks.
       -b. Modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) for dynamic decision-making.
       -c. Performs three main actions: managing memory, updating working memory, and interacting with the environment.

   -2. Structured Framework:
       -a. A reward-based policy selectively stores high-utility data and snippets.
       -b. Can adapt and learn without modifying core model parameters, relying instead on memory-based optimizations.

2. Phases of Operation
   -1. Phase I: Automation (Task Setup)
       -a. Fetches tasks from Kaggle and processes raw data into structured input maps based on modalities (e.g., tabular, image, text).
       -b. Modeled as an MDP, with pipeline stages defined by unit tests that determine progression.
       -c. Uses nested reasoning to identify and resolve errors via reflection (e.g., generating "META-ERROR-THOUGHTS" for root cause analysis).

   -2. Phase II: Optimization (Task Solution)
       -a. Applies tools like feature engineering, deep learning, AutoML, and Bayesian optimization for performance maximization.
       -b. Generates code to iteratively improve metrics and submits predictions to Kaggle for evaluation.
       -c. Customizes solutions for different modalities, using libraries like Torchvision, Torchtext, and HEBO.

   -3. Phase III: Generalization (Multi-Task Learning)
       -a. Supports multi-task and continual learning by sharing long-term memory across domains.
       -b. Builds a curriculum based on task similarity, difficulty, and recency, prioritizing tasks aligned with successful prior cases.

3. Experimental Results
   -1. Performance on Kaggle
       -a. Tested on 65 competitions, achieving:
           - 6 gold, 3 silver, and 7 bronze medals.
           - Top 38% ranking among Kaggle competitors (Elo-MMR score: 1542).
           - 92.5% success rate across tasks, matching Kaggle Grandmaster-level performance.

   -2. Task Success:
       -a. Gold medals in tabular data, computer vision, and NLP.
       -b. Achieved over 80th percentile in 22 tasks and above the 50th percentile in 62% of competitions.

   -3. Challenges:
       -a. Faced issues in non-converging losses, incorrect submissions, and class imbalances in a subset of tasks (<20th percentile performance).

4. Notable Contributions
   -1. Efficient Task Handling:
       -a. Adapts without computationally expensive methods like fine-tuning.
       -b. Employs memory-based learning for scalability and generalization.

   -2. High Dimensionality Handling:
       -a. Excels in multimodal data processing (e.g., tabular, vision, NLP) with structured reasoning.

   -3. Comparison to Humans:
        - Outperformed 63% of human competitors on Kaggle using automated workflows.

Agent K v1.0 showcases a robust approach to autonomous data science, providing a scalable, 
memory-driven alternative to traditional machine learning pipelines.
