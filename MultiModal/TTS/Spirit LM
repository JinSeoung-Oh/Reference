### From https://venturebeat.com/ai/meta-introduces-spirit-lm-open-source-model-that-combines-text-and-speech-inputs-outputs/

Meta has introduced Meta Spirit LM, its first open-source multimodal language model capable of processing both text and speech inputs and outputs. 
Developed by Meta’s Fundamental AI Research (FAIR) team, Spirit LM is positioned to compete with OpenAI's GPT-4o and models like Hume’s EVI 2. 
Unlike traditional voice AI models that rely on separate ASR (automatic speech recognition) and TTS (text-to-speech) components,
Spirit LM aims to provide a more integrated and expressive AI voice experience.

1. Key Features of Meta Spirit LM:
   -1. Two Model Versions:
        -a. Spirit LM Base: Focuses on phonetic tokens for handling and generating speech.
        -b. Spirit LM Expressive: Goes further by including tokens for pitch and tone, allowing the model to convey emotional cues like excitement or sadness.
       Expressive Speech Generation: By incorporating phonetic, pitch, and tone tokens, Spirit LM enhances the natural expressiveness of generated speech. 
       This helps capture nuances like emotional tone and varied intonation, which traditional models often lack.

   -2. Cross-Modal Capabilities: Spirit LM is trained on both text and speech datasets, enabling it to perform tasks like:
        -a. Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR): Converting spoken language into text.
        -b. Text-to-Speech (TTS): Converting written text into natural-sounding speech.
        -c. Speech Classification: Recognizing and categorizing speech based on content or emotional tone.

2. Open-Source Accessibility and Licensing:
   The model is available under Meta’s FAIR Noncommercial Research License, allowing researchers to use, modify, 
   and create derivative works for non-commercial purposes only. 
   This aligns with Meta’s emphasis on open science and aims to spur research and exploration in multimodal AI technologies.

3. Potential Applications:
   Spirit LM’s ability to integrate emotional cues makes it ideal for developing more engaging virtual assistants and interactive AI systems.
   Meta envisions the model being used in scenarios like:

   -1. Customer Service Bots: Offering more natural and human-like interactions.
   -2. Virtual Assistants: Enhancing expressiveness and responsiveness based on user inputs.
   -3. Broader Research and Future Directions:
   Meta Spirit LM is part of a broader research agenda at FAIR, which includes updates to models like Segment Anything Model 2.1 (SAM 2.1) 
   for image and video segmentation. 
   The overall aim is to contribute to the field of Advanced Machine Intelligence (AMI) while prioritizing accessibility and reproducibility in AI research.

Meta Spirit LM represents an ambitious push towards integrating expressive voice AI in real-world applications. 
This launch marks a significant step forward in bridging the gap between language and voice capabilities, fostering more natural and engaging AI interactions
