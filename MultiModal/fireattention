## Introduction:
Fireworks AI introduces the Fireworks LLM Serving Stack, aiming to enhance the efficiency of serving for Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, 
specifically focusing on the Mixtral model. The goal is to achieve a significantly more efficient serving with minimal impact on model quality.

## Key Points:
1. Mixtral and Fireworks AI:
   -1. Training Scale: Mixtral is the first open-source model trained on trillions of tokens with support for Mixture of Experts (MoE).
   -2. Hosting Platform: Fireworks AI, the first platform to host Mixtral, even before its public release.

2. Objectives:
   -1. Efficiency Improvement: The primary goal is to develop a more efficient serving for MoE models, specifically Mixtral.
   -2. Fireworks LLM Serving Stack: Introduced as a solution, utilizing FP16 and FP8-based FireAttention as the core component, 
       promising a 4x speedup compared to other open-source alternatives.
3. Setup:
   -1. Use Case Focus: The post focuses on a typical use case with a prompt length of 1K and generating 50 tokens, covering the long prompt, 
       short generation scenario.
   -2. Quality Metric: MMLU (Mixtral Mean Language Understanding) metric is used for assessing language understanding with a test dataset.

4. FireAttention:
   -1. Custom CUDA Kernel: FireAttention is a custom CUDA kernel optimized for Multi-Query Attention models, especially MoE models like Mixtral.
   -2. FP16 and FP8 Support: Optimized for FP16 and FP8 support in new hardware, particularly H100 GPUs.

5. Quality Analysis:
   -1. Half-Precision (FP16): Running the model in half-precision can leave performance on the table, and integer quantization methods 
       do not provide significant speed-ups.
   -2. FP8 Implementation: Fireworks AI introduces an FP8 implementation, running 3 experts per token, showing promising results 
       with a small base model quality impact.

6. Performance Analysis:
   -1. Comparison with vLLM: Fireworks FP16 Mixtral model implementation is deemed superior to vLLM. 
       The FP8 implementation in Fireworks significantly improves over the already efficient FP16 implementation.
   -2. Benefits of FP8: FP8 provides a 2x improvement in effective requests/second due to model size reduction, memory bandwidth, and FLOPs speed-ups.

## Conclusions:
Superiority of Fireworks LLM Stack: Fireworks FP16 Mixtral model implementation outperforms vLLM, 
and the FP8 implementation offers a significant improvement over FP16.
Efficient Deployment: FP8, by reducing the model size, allows for more efficient deployment,
resulting in a 2x improvement in effective requests/second.
No One-Size-Fits-All: Different configurations of both vLLM and Fireworks LLM service show strengths in different setups.
Fireworks FireAttention FP8: Considered the best tradeoff for LLM serving in terms of accuracy and performance.

## SO, What is FireAttention?
"FireAttention" is described as a custom CUDA kernel optimized for Multi-Query Attention models, 
particularly designed for models utilizing a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, with Mixtral being one such model

1. Optimization for MoE Models: FireAttention is specifically optimized for models that employ a Mixture of Experts architecture, 
                                such as Mixtral. MoE models utilize a combination of multiple expert networks to handle different aspects of the input data.

2. CUDA Kernel: FireAttention is implemented as a custom CUDA kernel. CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) is a parallel computing platform 
                and application programming interface model created by NVIDIA for utilizing their Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) for general-purpose processing.

3. FP16 and FP8 Support: FireAttention is designed to support both FP16 (half-precision) and FP8 (8-bit floating-point) formats. 
                         These formats are lower precision compared to the traditional FP32 (single-precision) but can offer performance benefits,  
                         especially on modern GPUs.

4. Optimized for New Hardware (H100): The kernel is specifically optimized for new hardware, notably mentioning H100 GPUs. 
                                      The H100 is likely a reference to NVIDIA's GPU architecture, and the optimization suggests that FireAttention 
                                      is tailored to take advantage of the features and capabilities of this hardware.

5. Memory Bandwidth Limit: FireAttention is mentioned to run close to the hardware memory bandwidth limit during generation for various batch sizes and sequence lengths.
                           This indicates that the kernel is designed to efficiently utilize the available memory bandwidth, a crucial aspect for performance.

6. Integrated into Fireworks LLM Serving Stack: FireAttention is a core part of the Fireworks proprietary LLM (Large Language Model) serving stack. 
                                                This stack includes CUDA kernels optimized for both FP16 and FP8. The integration into the serving stack suggests that 
                                                FireAttention plays a central role in the efficient serving of MoE models like Mixtral.

In summary, FireAttention is a custom CUDA kernel specifically crafted for MoE models, providing optimized support for lower-precision formats (FP16 and FP8) and designed 
to run efficiently on modern GPU hardware, with a focus on memory bandwidth utilization during generation. 
It is a key component of the Fireworks LLM serving stack, contributing to the acceleration of models like Mixtral with a focus on both performance and precision.
