### From https://waymo.com/blog/2025/12/demonstrably-safe-ai-for-autonomous-driving

Autonomous driving is defined in this article as the ultimate challenge for AI in the physical world, 
and Waymo explains that it addresses this challenge by prioritizing demonstrably safe AI. 
At Waymo, safety is not something added after the fact, but rather the foundational principle guiding the design of models, training, validation, and deployment.
As a result, Waymo has safely driven over 100 million fully autonomous miles and achieved more than a ten-fold reduction in crashes 
with serious injuries compared to human drivers in the areas where it operates.

The purpose of this article is to open Waymo’s “engine room” and provide a detailed explanation of Waymo’s AI strategy and the core mechanisms driving its progress. 
At the center of this strategy lies the Waymo Foundation Model, which enables a unified, safety-centric AI ecosystem composed of the Driver, Simulator, and Critic, 
and supports accelerated continuous learning and improvement.

1. Waymo’s Holistic Approach to AI
   Unlike other AI applications where capability may be optimized first and safety added later, Waymo emphasizes that such an approach is unacceptable
   for autonomous driving. In this domain, safety is a non-negotiable prerequisite and the foundation of the entire AI ecosystem.

   Achieving demonstrably safe AI requires more than a capable Driver model alone. It requires the joint development of three essential components:
   -a. A Driver that makes real-world driving decisions
   -b. A Simulator that trains and rigorously tests the Driver in a closed-loop environment across diverse and challenging scenarios
   -c. A Critic that evaluates the Driver’s behavior and identifies areas for improvement
   These components are not independent systems; they are designed together and powered by the same underlying AI, the Waymo Foundation Model, 
   forming a continuous virtuous cycle.

2. Waymo Foundation Model: The Core of Waymo AI
   The Waymo Foundation Model is a versatile, state-of-the-art world model that underpins Waymo’s AI ecosystem. 
   It adopts an architecture that goes beyond purely end-to-end or traditional modular approaches.

   Its key characteristics include the use of learned embeddings as a rich interface between model components, 
   support for full end-to-end backpropagation during training, and the maintenance of compact, materialized structured representations such as objects,
   semantic attributes, and roadgraph elements.

   These structured representations enable correctness and safety validation during Driver inference, 
   physically accurate and realistic large-scale closed-loop simulation, and strong verifiable feedback signals for Critic evaluation and reinforcement learning.

3. Think Fast and Think Slow Architecture
   The Waymo Foundation Model employs a Think Fast / Think Slow (System 1 / System 2) architecture.
   -a. The Sensor Fusion Encoder rapidly fuses camera, lidar, and radar inputs over time to produce objects, semantics, and rich embeddings,
       supporting fast and safe driving decisions.
   -b. The Driving VLM performs slower, complex semantic reasoning using rich camera data. Fine-tuned on Waymo driving tasks and trained with Gemini, 
       it leverages extensive world knowledge to interpret rare and complex situations, 
       such as recognizing that a vehicle on fire ahead warrants rerouting even when the physical road space appears passable.
   Outputs from both encoders feed into the World Decoder, which predicts other road users’ behavior, produces high-definition maps, generates vehicle trajectories,
   and outputs trajectory validation signals.

4. Teacher–Student Distillation in the AI Ecosystem
   The Waymo Foundation Model is adapted to the Driver, Simulator, and Critic to create high-quality Teacher models. 
   Because these models are too large for real-time onboard use or massive simulation, 
   Waymo applies knowledge distillation to transfer their capabilities into smaller, efficient Student models.

   This approach enables real-time deployment and large-scale simulation while retaining the performance of large models. 
   It reflects a broader trend in AI: training powerful high-capacity models first and then distilling them leads to better scaling behavior.

5. Roles of Driver, Simulator, and Critic
   The Driver Teacher models generate safe, comfortable, and compliant actions, which are distilled into Student models optimized for onboard deployment. 
   A separate and rigorous onboard validation layer independently verifies generated trajectories.

   The Simulator enables closed-loop training and testing across collisions, adverse weather, complex intersections, and unusual road behavior. 
   The Foundation Model architecture allows the seamless combination of structured world states and sensor simulation to produce large-scale, 
   hyper-realistic, physically accurate, and computationally efficient virtual environments.

   The Critic stress-tests the Driver, identifies subtle edge cases, and generates high-quality evaluation signals. 
   Teacher Critic models produce rich feedback, while Student Critic models analyze driving logs to detect problematic scenarios 
   and provide nuanced assessments of driving quality.

   Together, these components form an integrated AI ecosystem and a continuous improvement flywheel.

6. Learning Flywheels for Continuous Improvement
   The Waymo Driver evolves through continuous learning.
   -a. An inner learning loop uses reinforcement learning within the Simulator and Critic to train the Driver at massive scale in a safe, controlled environment.
   -b. An outer learning loop leverages real-world fully autonomous driving data. 
   The Critic flags suboptimal behaviors, improved alternatives are generated as training data, fixes are validated in simulation, 
   and only after the safety framework confirms the absence of unreasonable risk is the improved Driver deployed to the real world.

   This flywheel is enabled by Waymo’s unprecedented volume of fully autonomous driving data. Such real-world experience cannot be replaced by simulation 
   or manual driving data, and integrating it directly into the learning loop allows the Driver to learn from its own experience and continuously improve.

7. Conclusion
   By embracing a holistic AI approach and building powerful learning flywheels, Waymo is not only advancing autonomous driving technology 
   but also setting the standard for safe autonomous driving at scale. 
   With safety as the foundation, Waymo continues to innovate and push the boundaries of what AI can achieve in the physical world.
