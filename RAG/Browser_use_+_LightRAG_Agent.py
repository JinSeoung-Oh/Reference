"""
This article outlines the integration of LightRAG and Browser-Use to create an advanced chatbot capable of scraping 
websites and performing contextual queries. 
It presents a novel approach to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems and web automation for developing AI agents. 
Here's a detailed breakdown of the components and their functionality:

1. Key Components
   -1. Browser-Use
       -a. Purpose: An open-source web automation library enabling interaction between LLMs and web pages.
       -b. Capabilities:
           -1) Handles cookies, pop-ups, and multi-tab navigation.
           -2) Automates tasks like data scraping, form filling, and webpage navigation.
           -3) Employs vision models for taking and analyzing screenshots.
           -4) Self-corrects errors and adjusts dynamically during web interactions.
       -c. Applications:
           -1) Data extraction from websites.
           -2) Intelligent information querying and summarization.

   -2. LightRAG
       -a. Purpose: Enhances RAG by integrating graph-based structures for better indexing and retrieval.
       
       -b. Key Features:
           -1) Two-level retrieval system:
               - Low-Level Search: Focused on specific entities or relationships.
               - High-Level Search: Broader, more abstract themes.
           -2) Efficient handling of complex interdependencies and contextual queries.
           -3) Reduces token usage compared to traditional RAG systems.
           
       -c. Advantage over GraphRAG:
           -1) Efficiency: Significantly lower API calls and token usage.
           -2) Versatility: Better adaptation to dynamic data environments.

2. How It Works
   -1. Web Automation with Browser-Use
       -a. Agent Initialization:
           -1) Each agent is tasked with a specific goal (e.g., searching for articles or extracting information).
           -2) Agents share a browser session via a Controller, ensuring state persistence across interactions.
       -b. Task Execution:
           -1) Actions include identifying webpage elements, interacting with forms, and collecting data.
           -2) Results are saved and analyzed using connected LLMs.
           
   -2.Knowledge Integration with LightRAG
      -a. Graph-Based Indexing:
          -1) Entities (e.g., people, organizations, concepts) and their relationships are extracted to build a knowledge graph.
          -2) For instance, from “Andrew Yan is researching artificial intelligence at Google Brain,” LightRAG extracts:
              - Entities: Andrew Yan, Google Brain, artificial intelligence.
              - Relationships: Andrew Yan → Research → AI; Andrew Yan → Affiliation → Google Brain.

      -b. Search Modes:
          -1) Naive Search: Direct keyword matches.
          -2) Local Search: Considers direct relationships in the knowledge graph.
          -3) Global Search: Explores indirect relationships for a broader context.
          -4) Hybrid Search: Combines local and global insights for a balanced approach.

    -3. Query Processing:
        -a. Using the extracted content, queries like "What is Supervised Fine-Tuning?" are processed across different 
            search modes to retrieve relevant information effectively.

# Implementation Steps
# -1. Setup and Configuration
#      Install necessary libraries & Import required modules
pip install -r requirements.txt

from browser_use import Agent, Controller
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from lightrag.lightrag import LightRAG, QueryParam
import os

# -2. Code Workflow
controller = Controller()
agent = Agent(
    task="Go to google.com and find the article about Lora llm and extract everything about Lora",
    llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o", timeout=25, stop=None),
    controller=controller
)

async def main():
    max_steps = 20
    for i in range(max_steps):
        action, result = await agent.step()
        if result.done:
            with open('text.txt', 'w') as file:
                file.write(result.extracted_content)
            break

rag = LightRAG(
    working_dir="./dickens",
    llm_model_func=gpt_4o_mini_complete
)

with open("text.txt") as f:
    rag.insert(f.read())

print(rag.query("What is Supervised Fine-Tuning", param=QueryParam(mode="naive")))
print(rag.query("What is Supervised Fine-Tuning", param=QueryParam(mode="local")))
print(rag.query("What is Supervised Fine-Tuning", param=QueryParam(mode="global")))
print(rag.query("What is Supervised Fine-Tuning", param=QueryParam(mode="hybrid")))
