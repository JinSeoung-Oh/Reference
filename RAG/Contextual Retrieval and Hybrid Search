Combining contextual BM25 with contextual embeddings offers a significant improvement to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems,
enhancing retrieval accuracy and reducing the potential for hallucinations. 

1. RAG Overview and Challenges
   RAG is a system designed to augment the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by retrieving relevant external documents to enhance context 
   and provide more accurate responses. However, traditional RAG systems often face challenges:

   -1. Context loss when documents are split into smaller chunks.
   -2. Dependence on embeddings for semantic search, which may miss relevant documents that rely on term-based matching.

2. Contextual Retrieval
   Anthropic introduced contextual retrieval, a method to retain context when splitting documents for retrieval. 
   Each document chunk is contextualized by adding relevant information (such as names or time periods) before it is embedded, 
   ensuring that crucial context is preserved during search and retrieval. 
   For example, if a chunk mentions "3% revenue growth," adding the company name and time period ensures this context is embedded along with the chunk.

3. Hybrid Search: BM25 and Embeddings
   While contextual embeddings improve traditional semantic search, a hybrid approach that incorporates BM25 alongside embeddings leads to even better results.
   BM25 is a term-based algorithm that excels in capturing term frequency and document length relevance, 
   but it may miss out on semantic meaning. On the other hand, embedding-based search captures the deeper semantic relationships between query and document content.

   - BM25: It manages term saturation and adjusts for document length using parameters k1 (term frequency saturation) and b (document length penalty).
           These help balance the relevance of short and long documents, but BM25 might struggle with understanding the semantic meaning.
   - Contextual Embeddings: Represent documents as vectors in a dense space, allowing retrieval based on cosine similarity. 
                            This method captures semantic overlaps but can overlook exact keyword matches that BM25 would catch.

   The hybrid approach combines both by applying Reciprocal Rank, where the results from BM25 and embedding searches are merged. 
   The relative weights assigned to each method allow fine-tuning, ensuring the final ranking gives proper weight to both semantic relevance and term-based matching.
   For example, if BM25 is weighted at 0.2 and embeddings at 0.8, a document ranked lower in BM25 but high in embeddings can still be prioritized.

4. Performance Boost
   By combining these two methods, the hybrid approach improves both:

   - Precision: Ensuring the most relevant documents or chunks are retrieved.
   - Recall: Increasing the likelihood that all necessary documents are retrieved, reducing the chance of missing critical information.
   In Anthropicâ€™s case, this hybrid approach reduced the retrieval failure rate by nearly 49%, significantly improving performance in real-world tasks.

5. Evaluation of RAG Systems
   Effective RAG systems rely not just on generation quality but also on the quality of the retrieved context. 
   Two important metrics help evaluate RAG retrieval systems:

   -1. Context Precision: The proportion of retrieved documents that are actually relevant to the query. 
                          This metric ensures that the added context is useful for the answer and prevents overloading the model with irrelevant content.
   -2. Context Recall: The proportion of all relevant documents that are successfully retrieved. Low recall suggests the need for better retrieval mechanisms.

6. Conclusion
   Combining contextual embeddings and contextual BM25 provides a robust hybrid search approach that overcomes the limitations of 
   both semantic and term-based search methods individually. This combination results in higher precision, recall, and retrieval accuracy, 
   ultimately improving the effectiveness of RAG systems. The hybrid model balances deep semantic understanding with traditional keyword relevance,
   unlocking new levels of performance in information retrieval for tasks like answering complex queries or generating context-aware responses.
