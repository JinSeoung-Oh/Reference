Golden-Retriever presents a structured and innovative approach to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for specialized industrial contexts, 
where it tackles domain-specific jargon and ambiguous terminology that traditional RAG setups struggle with. 
Here's a breakdown of how Golden-Retriever enhances retrieval accuracy through its multi-step approach:

1. LLM-Driven Document Augmentation
   Golden-Retriever first augments documents offline by processing proprietary documents (e.g., PDFs, slides) through OCR and generating summaries with LLMs. 
   These summaries are stored in the database, adding a layer of semantic enrichment that boosts the relevance of retrieved documents.

2. Jargon Identification
   Upon receiving a user query, the system pinpoints domain-specific jargon using an LLM to scan and structure unfamiliar terms. 
   This stage prevents misinterpretation of specialized terms by setting the foundation for accurate retrieval.

3. Context Identification
   Contextual classification is crucial, especially when ambiguous terms (like “RAG”) might have different meanings depending on the field. 
   Golden-Retriever uses predefined categories to ensure the system interprets the jargon within the correct context.

4. Jargon Querying
   With the identified jargon and context, the system queries a jargon dictionary, adding clarity to the user’s question and ensuring terms 
   are understood within the relevant field.

5. Question Augmentation
   The augmented query combines refined jargon and context details, transforming ambiguous queries into precise ones that are better suited for RAG, 
   improving the retrieval of accurate and contextually relevant documents.

6. Query Miss Response
   Golden-Retriever includes a fallback mechanism when terms are missing in the jargon dictionary, 
   advising users to check spelling or consult the knowledge base manager. This feature helps maintain high-quality, accurate responses.

7. Evaluation and Results
   In domain-specific question-answering tests, Golden-Retriever showed higher accuracy than standard LLM and RAG methods, 
   indicating significant improvement in handling industry-specific queries.

Golden-Retriever’s methodology is particularly valuable for industries with complex knowledge bases, 
as it enhances query relevance by preemptively addressing ambiguities. 
However, its reliance on LLM-driven processes can be computationally intensive, potentially limiting scalability.
