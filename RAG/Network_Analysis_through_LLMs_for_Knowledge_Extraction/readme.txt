Mind Mapper leverages RAG to create intermediate result representations useful to perform some kind of knowledge intelligence 
which is allows us in turn to better understand the output results of RAG over long and unstructured documents.

Here are some of the tool’s features:
1. Manages text in basically all forms: copy-paste, textual and originating from audio source (video is contemplated too if the project is well received)
2. Uses an in-project SQLite database for data persistence
3. Leverages the state-of-the-art Upstash vector database to store vectors efficiently
4. Chunks from the vector database are then used to create a knowledge graph of the information
5. A final LLM is called to comment on the knowledge graph and extract insights

Refer this file, maybe can build good KG
