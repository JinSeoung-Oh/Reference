The concept of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has indeed proven to be a powerful technique for enhancing the capabilities 
of large language models (LLMs). 
The integration of relevant information from knowledge sources into prompts provides contextual grounding for LLM outputs. 
However, single-agent RAG systems have faced challenges such as inefficient retrieval, high latency, and suboptimal prompt engineering.
The adoption of multi-agent architectures presents a promising solution to overcome these challenges and unlock the full potential of RAG. 
By dividing the RAG workflow into specialized roles executed concurrently by different agents, 
multi-agent systems offer flexibility, specialization, and collaboration to optimize the entire process.

Limitations of Single-Agent RAG
1. Bottlenecks and Inefficiencies
   * Single-agent systems face bottlenecks, especially in handling tasks like passage retrieval from extensive corpora.
   * Inefficient retrieval of marginally relevant passages leads to wasted time and resources.
2. Latency Issues
   * Retrieving information from large databases results in latency spikes, making real-time applications challenging.
3. Suboptimal Summarization
   * Long contexts are often summarized poorly, affecting the overall quality of the generated prompts.

Advantages of Multi-Agent RAG
1. Factored Retrieval
   * Dedicated retriever agents focus solely on efficient passage retrieval, minimizing latency.
2. Parallelized Search
   * Retrieval tasks are parallelized across multiple agents, reducing wait times and improving efficiency
3. Specialized Ranking
   * Separate ranker agents evaluate retrieved passages based on various relevance signals, filtering for maximal relevance.
4. Distilled Summarization
   * Reader agents specialize in summarizing lengthy contexts into concise snippets, improving the quality of information extraction.
5. Optimized Prompting
   * Orchestrator agents dynamically adjust the integration of the original prompt and retrieved information for optimal results.
6. Flexible Architecture
   * Agents can be substituted or added to tailor the system to specific needs. Visualizer agents can provide insights into the workflow.

Multi-Agent RAG in Action
  The example of the Llama index demonstrates the implementation of multi-agent RAG using document agents, 
  vector indexes, summary indexes, and a top-level agent for coordination. 
  This system showcases real benefits over single-agent RAG baselines, particularly in multi-document question-answering scenarios.
