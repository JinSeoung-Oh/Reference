1. Multimodal RAG Overview
   -1. Concept
       Multimodal RAG extends traditional RAG systems by incorporating multiple forms of information, such as text, images, and videos, into a multimodal model.
       Instead of retrieving only text based on a user's prompt, a multimodal RAG system can retrieve and utilize data from various modalities.
   -2. Purpose
       The goal is to enhance the capabilities of language models by allowing them to process and integrate diverse data types, 
       leading to richer and more informative outputs.

2. Approaches to Multimodal RAG
  -1. Shared Vector Space
      - Description
        This approach uses an embedding that works across multiple modalities, similar to the CLIP model. 
        Data is processed through encoders that are designed to integrate seamlessly, 
        allowing retrieval of the most similar data across all modalities in response to a user's query.
      - Implementation
        Systems like Google's Vertex AI provide multimodal embedding solutions, placing data from different modalities into a common embedding space.

  -2. Single Grounded Modality
      - Description
        In this approach, all data modalities are converted into a single modality, typically text, before being processed by a single encoder.
      - Advantages
        This method simplifies processing and reduces complexity while maintaining high-quality results in many applications.
      - Challenges
        There is a theoretical risk of losing subtle information during the conversion process, but practical implementations often mitigate this risk effectively.

   -3. Separate Retrieval
       - Description
         This approach involves using a collection of models, each designed to work with specific modalities. Retrieval is performed separately for each modality, 
         and the results are combined.
       - Implementation
         The combined retrievals can be simply aggregated and fed into a multimodal model, or more sophisticated methods
         like re-ranking can be used to organize data based on its relevance to the query.
       - Benefits
         This approach is flexible, allowing optimization for different modalities and accommodating modalities not supported by existing models.
