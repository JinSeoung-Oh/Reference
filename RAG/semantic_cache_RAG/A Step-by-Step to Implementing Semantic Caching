## Introduction
   Generative AI, a transformative subset of artificial intelligence, is increasingly recognized 
   for its potential across numerous sectors. 
   Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is committed to democratizing generative AI by providing accessible foundational models, 
   scalable infrastructure, and comprehensive tools for tuning, deployment, and maintenance.
   One critical term that frequently emerges in the context of generative AI and large language models (LLMs) is ‘semantic caching.’

   Semantic caching addresses significant challenges developers face with LLMs, particularly latency and cost. 
   By caching responses to semantically similar queries, it reduces redundant API calls, 
   thereby enhancing user experience and cutting operational costs.

## Understanding Semantic Caching
   Semantic caching interprets the meaning behind queries, enabling it to provide precomputed responses for semantically similar inputs.
   This differs from traditional caching, which relies on exact matches. By storing semantic representations, 
   query resolution is sped up, improving response times and resource utilization.

  # Benefits of Semantic Caching
    - Speed: Faster response times by retrieving precomputed answers for semantically similar queries.
    - Cost Efficiency: Reduces redundant API calls, cutting costs associated with LLM usage.
    - Scalability: Handles larger query volumes, preventing performance bottlenecks.
    - Throughput: Increases the system's ability to process queries efficiently, crucial for high-throughput applications.

## Implementation Scenario: Document Question Answering System
   Consider a GenAI application gaining significant traction, processing numerous API calls daily. 
   Users often pose similar queries, leading to redundant token processing and increased costs. 
   Implementing semantic caching can mitigate these issues.

   Example:
   - Without Caching: Retrieval time ~6504 ms.
   - With Semantic Caching: Retrieval time ~1919 ms (3.4x improvement).
   - Exact Match Queries: Retrieval time ~53 ms (123x improvement).

## Architecture and Workflow
   - Data Preprocessing
     - 1. Dataset: Quarterly reports from Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft (Q1 2021 to Q4 2023).
     - 2. Document Processing: Using Google Cloud’s DocumentAI to extract and clean text and table data from PDF reports.
   - Semantic Indexing
     - 1. Encoding Documents: Use Vertex AI’s text embedding API to encode processed pages.
     - 2. Creating Semantic Index: Use Vertex AI Vector Search to index these embeddings.
   - Standard Caching
     - 1. Memorystore Setup: Use Google Cloud Memorystore for storing exact match question-answer pairs.
     - 2. Populating Cache: Insert question-answer pairs from the dataset into Memorystore.
   - End-to-End Workflow
     -1 Exact Match
        Hash the incoming query.
        Check if the hash exists in the standard cache.
        If found, retrieve the answer directly from the cache.
     - 2. Semantic Match:
          Encode the incoming question using the text embedding model.
          Match against the semantic index to find similar questions.
          Check the standard cache for the matching question’s answer.
          If not found, perform a native semantic search on the document index.
          Generate the answer using Gemini 1.0 Pro if no match is found in the cache.
          Store the new question-answer pair in the semantic index and the standard cache.

## Enhancements and Additional Considerations
   1. Lexical/Syntactical Similarity: Implement a normalization step to capture minor query variations, enhancing exact match accuracy.  
   2. Entity Extraction: Use LLMs to ensure accuracy for numeric and time-related queries.
   3. Efficient Caching: Hash both questions and answers to avoid duplicate storage.
   4. Threshold Optimization: Dynamically determine the confidence threshold through pre-warm exercises.
   5. Cache Management: Use TTL (time-to-live) settings to optimize cache memory usage and manage billions of queries efficiently.

## Conclusion
   Semantic caching, integrated with GCP’s suite of AI services, offers a robust solution for improving the efficiency and scalability 
   of generative AI applications. By reducing latency, cutting costs, and enhancing query processing capabilities,
   semantic caching ensures an optimal user experience and efficient resource utilization. 
   Implementing this strategy in a document question-answering system demonstrates its practical benefits, 
   setting the stage for broader adoption in various AI-driven applications.
