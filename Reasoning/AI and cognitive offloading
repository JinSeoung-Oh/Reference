The article explores the concept of "externalized thought" within the framework of distributed cognition, 
emphasizing how humans offload cognitive tasks onto external tools, environments, and even AI systems. 
It discusses the implications of this phenomenon for designing AI-driven interfaces and systems that seamlessly integrate with human thought processes,
thereby reducing cognitive burden and enhancing collaborative problem-solving.

1. Distributed Cognition and Externalized Thought
   -a. Distributed Cognition Defined:
       -1. Cognition isn’t confined to an isolated mind but is spread across people, tools, and the environment. 
           This perspective challenges the traditional view of the mind as a solitary processor.
       -2. Example: In a car navigation scenario, both the driver and the navigator (using a phone) contribute to thinking, 
                    forming a distributed cognitive system where technology and human minds collaborate.

   -b. Origins and Theory:
       -1. Introduced by Edwin Hutchins in "Cognition in the Wild", distributed cognition was observed in complex tasks like naval navigation 
           where cognitive tasks are shared among individuals, tools, and over time.
           - Key dimensions:
             Humans and Environment: Use of tools (compasses, maps, GPS) to extend thinking.
             Multiple Individuals: Collaboration among team members enhances problem-solving.
             Time: Building on past knowledge and cultural artifacts to inform present cognition.

    -c. Modern Relevance:
        With AI becoming integral, design must account for dynamic interaction between humans, AI agents, and context, 
        shifting focus from isolated cognition to hybrid systems.

2. Cognitive Offloading and Design Principles
   -a. Cognitive Offloading:
       -1. The act of transferring cognitive tasks to external resources—tools, devices, collaborators—to reduce mental effort and fatigue.
       -2. Examples include using calculators, navigation apps, or AI assistants to handle routine or complex tasks, 
           freeing human minds for higher-order thinking.

3. Principles for Designing AI Systems with Externalized Thought
   -a. Understanding User Pain Points:
       -1. Recognize cognitive effort as a form of "pain" that users want to avoid.
       -2. Identify where users struggle and design features that offload these burdens, reducing decision fatigue.
       -3. Example: Braintrust simplifies job post creation by transforming simple briefs into polished drafts, reducing effort.
   -b. Promoting Collaborative Problem-Solving:
       -1. Design tools that act as cognitive partners, facilitating collaboration between humans and AI.
       -2. Example: Craft App and Red Sift Radar offer AI assistance to overcome writer’s block or evaluate domain trustworthiness, 
                    effectively sharing the cognitive load.
   -c. Using Existing Mental Models and Patterns:
       -1. Leverage familiar interface patterns to reduce learning curves and cognitive load.
       -2. Example: Relume uses recognizable visual cues (purple accents, sparkle emojis) to highlight AI features, 
                    aligning with user expectations and easing interaction.

4. Leveraging Progressive Disclosure:
   -a. Introduce complexity gradually to avoid overwhelming users.
   -b. Use wizards or step-by-step guides to manage tasks incrementally.
   -c. Examples:
       - Airtable uses a wizard-like flow to guide users through AI-assisted app creation.
       - Jasper presents functionality through simple tiles and templates, focusing on outcomes rather than technical processes.

5. Ensuring Graceful Failure:
   -a. Design AI systems to handle errors transparently and helpfully.
   -b. Provide clear feedback, suggestions, or fallback options when mistakes occur to maintain user trust.
   -c. Example: Google Search corrects misspellings and suggests alternatives rather than showing irrelevant results.

6. Contextual Guidance:
   -a. Offer assistance, tooltips, and prompts precisely when and where users need them.
   -b. Help users build mental models of AI capabilities through integrated guidance.
   -c. Example: June AI provides starting prompts for user queries post data connection, guiding users on what questions they can ask.

7. Conclusion
   Designing for externalized thought involves recognizing that cognition extends beyond the individual to include tools, collaborators, 
   and AI systems. By applying principles like understanding user pain points, promoting collaboration, using familiar patterns, 
   leveraging progressive disclosure, ensuring graceful failure, and providing contextual guidance, 
   designers can create AI applications that seamlessly offload cognitive tasks. This approach not only reduces user effort and frustration 
   but also empowers more effective human-AI collaboration, ultimately amplifying human potential.
