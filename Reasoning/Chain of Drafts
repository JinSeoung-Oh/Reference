1. Overview
   For several months, Chain of Thought (CoT) has been the de facto prompting method for leveraging LLMs like ChatGPT. 
   While CoT excels at detailed multi-step reasoning, its verbosity can lead to unnecessarily long responses. 
   Chain of Drafts (CoD) is introduced as a more concise prompting method that retains the essential reasoning steps 
   while significantly reducing token usage and speeding up inference.

2. What is Chain of Drafts (CoD)?
   -a. Concept:
       CoD is a prompting technique that minimizes verbosity by condensing reasoning into succinct "drafts" of the essential
       steps needed to solve a problem.
   -b. Key Characteristics:
       -1. Less Verbosity: Eliminates overly detailed explanations.
       -2. Fewer Tokens: Reduces computational costs.
       -3. Faster Responses: Ideal for real-time applications.

3. Comparison: CoD vs. CoT vs. Standard Prompting
   -a. Standard Prompting:
       Directly answers a question without detailing the reasoning process (e.g., "8" for a math problem).
   -b. Chain of Thought (CoT):
       Provides a detailed, step-by-step explanation (e.g., breaking down each subtraction step in a math problem).
   -c. Chain of Drafts (CoD):
       Offers a concise representation of reasoning (e.g., "20–12 = 8 → Final Answer: 8"), 
       striking a balance between brevity and clarity.

4. Advantages and Disadvantages
   -a. Advantages of CoD:
       -1. Faster Inference: Generates responses quicker due to lower token usage.
       -2. Lower Computational Cost: Fewer tokens lead to reduced operational expenses.
       -3. Concise Outputs: Ideal for applications where brevity is essential.
       -4. Easier Production Integration: Less verbose reasoning is more user-friendly in production systems.
   -b. Disadvantages of CoD:
       -1. Less Transparency: Lacks the detailed step-by-step breakdown of CoT, 
                              which can be useful for debugging and understanding the reasoning.
       -2. Potential for Error in Complex Tasks: Complex problems that require in-depth intermediate reasoning might suffer 
                                                 from omitted steps.
       -3. Not Ideal for Learning: Detailed explanations are often more beneficial for educational purposes.

5. Where CoD Excels
   CoD is best suited for:
   -a. Real-Time Applications: Customer support, personal assistants, and chatbots where speed and resource efficiency 
                               are critical.
   -b. Resource-Constrained Environments: Ideal for edge devices or systems with limited compute resources.
   -c. Summarization Tasks: Quickly distilling key points from dense text without excess detail.
   -d. Cost-Sensitive Deployments: Reducing the token count directly lowers computational costs.

6. Naming: Why "Chain of Drafts"?
   The term "Chain of Drafts" originates from the idea of producing a rough draft—a minimal outline of reasoning—rather
   than a fully elaborated essay. 
   CoD generates brief, essential reasoning steps that maintain logical coherence without the verbosity of
   a full chain of thought, making it both efficient and token-economical.

7. Conclusion
   Chain of Drafts (CoD) offers a powerful tweak to traditional prompting methods. By balancing concise reasoning with 
   accuracy, CoD achieves nearly the same performance as CoT but with fewer tokens, faster inference, 
   and lower computational costs. This makes it especially attractive for real-time applications and
   resource-constrained environments, while still providing sufficient insight into the reasoning process when needed.
