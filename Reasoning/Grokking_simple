1. What is Known About Grokking
   -1. Observation of Grokking
       Grokking was first observed in simple tasks, like modular arithmetic, where a model trained for a prolonged period first overfits (memorizes the data)
       and then suddenly starts generalizing, often long after typical training would have stopped. 
       This delayed phase shift from memorization to generalization is the core of grokking.

   -2. The Role of Overfitting
       Traditional training aims to avoid overfitting because it leads to poor generalization. In grokking, however, overfitting seems to be a necessary precursor. 
       Only after the model has thoroughly memorized the training data does it begin to simplify and discover more general principles, 
       leading to improved performance on unseen data.

   -3. Simpler Representations and Regularization
       One hypothesis is that during extended training, models eventually “find” simpler, more compact representations of the task at hand. 
       These simpler representations might align better with broader generalization. 
       This idea aligns with principles like Occam’s Razor—simpler solutions often generalize better.

   -4. The Shift from Memorization to Understanding
       In practical terms, during grokking, models seem to transition from relying on specific, overly detailed patterns (which don’t generalize well) to more abstract patterns 
       that capture the underlying structure of the task.

2. What Remains Unclear
   -1. Why Does the Transition Happen?
       While it’s observed that grokking occurs after a model overfits, the exact mechanism that drives the model to transition from memorization to generalization is 
       still poorly understood. Is it a gradual refinement of the loss landscape, or does the model discover a hidden structure in the data
       only after exhaustive exposure? Researchers don’t yet fully understand what triggers this shift.

   -2. Does Grokking Depend on Specific Architectures or Data Types?
       Grokking has been most prominently observed in simpler tasks and smaller models, like those used for modular arithmetic or basic compositional reasoning. 
       Whether the same process scales effectively to more complex tasks and larger models is still an open question.
       It’s unclear if grokking is a generalizable phenomenon across all types of data and architectures.

   -3. The Role of Training Dynamics
       The interaction between different training components (e.g., learning rates, batch sizes, regularization methods) and grokking is still not fully understood. 
       How do specific choices in these parameters impact whether or not grokking occurs?

   -4. The Bottom Line
       Grokking represents a fascinating phenomenon where models seem to transition from memorizing data to truly understanding it after extended training.
       However, the exact reason why grokking happens remains an open question. Researchers continue to explore whether it’s a byproduct of the optimization process, 
       something related to the loss landscape, or an emergent property of the model's internal representations. While there are hypotheses and observations,
       a fully satisfying explanation is still out of reach.
