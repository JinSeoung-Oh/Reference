1. Context & Motivation
   -a. LLMs like GPT-4 and Claude 3.5 have demonstrated human-expert level performance in textual reasoning, 
       such as logical and mathematical problem-solving.
   -b. However, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) still struggle with deep multimodal reasoning (e.g., geometric proofs, scientific analysis).
   -c. This gap motivated Skywork AI to develop Skywork R1V, a multimodal reasoning model.

2. What is Skywork R1V?
   -a. A 38B parameter multimodal model designed to transfer the reasoning ability of Skywork's R1 text model into the visual domain.
   -b. It introduces three innovations:
       -1. Efficient Multimodal Transfer via a lightweight visual projector.
       -2. Hybrid Optimization Framework using SFT + RL (GRPO).
       -3. Adaptive-Length Chain-of-Thought Distillation (AL-CoTD).

3. How Skywork R1V Works
   -a. Efficient Multimodal Transfer
       -1. Problem: Directly linking a vision backbone with a reasoning LLM requires large multimodal datasets.
       -2. Solution: Decouple the vision-language alignment from reasoning transfer.
       -3. Three-step process:
           -1) MLP Initialization
               - Train a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to bridge a ViT encoder with Qwen2.5–32B-Instruct (non-reasoning LLM).
           -2) Model Re-Assembly
               - Reuse the trained MLP to connect the same ViT to the reasoning-capable DeepSeek-R1-distill-Qwen2.5–32B model.
           -3) Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning
               - Only the MLP is fine-tuned. Both ViT and LLM weights are kept frozen.
      ViT (Vision Transformer) is the vision encoder used and stays unchanged throughout.
  -b. Hybrid Optimization Framework
      -1. Combines Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO).
      -2. Three stages:
          -1) Initial SFT
              - Train base model using the entire dataset.
          -2) Iterative SFT
              - Use a reward model to select high-quality samples.
              - Threshold for quality increases over iterations (e.g., score ≥2 → ≥3 → ... ≥5).
              - Also includes “hard” misclassified examples from previous steps.
          -3) GRPO Reinforcement Learning
              - Uses a ReLU-based reward to improve bad responses without harming good ones.
      This progressively aligns visual and textual features for multimodal reasoning.
  -c. Adaptive-Length Chain-of-Thought Distillation (AL-CoTD)
      -a. Purpose: Prevent overthinking or generating unnecessarily long reasoning chains.
      -b. Components:
          -1. QDAM (Quality and Difficulty Assessment Module)
              -1) Uses GPT-4o to score image-text queries:
                  - Vision score (clarity, relevance)
                  - Text score (difficulty, reasoning depth)
          -2. VTIA (Vision-Text Integration Analyzer)
              -1) Analyzes syntactic & semantic structure to determine reasoning depth.
          -3. DRLC (Dynamic Reasoning Length Controller)
              -1) Modulates repetition penalty based on query complexity:
                  - Hard → low penalty → longer chain
                  - Easy → high penalty → shorter chain
     Enables dynamic chain-of-thought lengths for efficient inference.

4. Performance & Evaluation
   -a. Benchmarks
       -1. Textual Reasoning:
           -1) MATH-500: 94.0

       -2. Multimodal Reasoning:
           -1) MathVista: 67.5
           -2) MMMU: 69.0
   -b. Comparison with other models:
       -1. Outperforms Claude 3.5 Sonnet on MathVista (67.5 vs. 65.3)
       -2. Matches GPT-4o on MMMU (69.0 vs. 69.1)
       -3. With only 38B parameters, matches/exceeds many larger closed/open models

5. Case Studies: Reasoning Examples
   -a. Pentagon Angle Problem (Geometry + Algebra):
       -1. Applies geometric rules
       -2. Builds linear equation from symbolic angles
       -3. Solves for variable

       -2. Identifies gender differences

   → These illustrate systematic reasoning and multimodal integration.

6. Training Progress and Observations
   -a. Iterative SFT raised performance from 60.2 → 65.6
   -b. GRPO RL further boosted it to 69.0
   -c. RL phase caused longer, more complete answers, aligning with prior "aha moment" trends in RL-trained models.
