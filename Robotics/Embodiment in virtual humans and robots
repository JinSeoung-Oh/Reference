1. Embodiment in AI
   Embodiment is critical for both robots and virtual humans. 
   It involves connecting an AI's "brain" to a "body" that interacts with the world, grounding AI in a 3D environment.

2. SMPL Model
   SMPL is a 3D model representing human shape and movement, essential for creating virtual humans. 
   It encodes human body shape, pose, facial expressions, and movements in a compact form of about 100 parameters.

3. Virtual Humans as Robots
   Virtual humans are akin to robots in a virtual world, perceiving, understanding, planning, and executing actions. 
   Key differences include the need for human-like motion and flexible physics modeling in virtual environments, 
   unlike physical robots.

4. Universal Humanoid
   SMPL serves as a universal language for human behavior, enabling translation of various data forms into human movements. 
   This facilitates retargeting human movements to new virtual characters or physical robots.

5. AMASS Dataset
   AMASS is a large collection of 3D human movement data in SMPL format, used extensively for training AI models
   to understand and generate human motion. It supports various applications, 
   including generating movements from text or speech.

6. Learning from Humans
   AMASS data is used to train both virtual humans and robots. Robust methods exist for estimating SMPL from video, 
   enabling robots to learn from human demonstrations encoded in SMPL format.

7. SMPL as Latent Space
   SMPL acts as a compact, interpretable latent space in machine learning, efficiently representing human body shape and pose. 
   This minimal representation is achieved through a biomechanically accurate model.

Conclusion 
Embodiment extends beyond physical robots to virtual humans, with SMPL acting as a "virtual robot" 
and a universal language for human movement, facilitating the transfer of human behaviors to various embodiments.
