Genesis is a physics platform designed for general purpose Robotics/Embodied AI/Physical AI applications. 
It is simultaneously multiple things:

1. A universal physics engine re-built from the ground up, capable of simulating a wide range of materials and physical phenomena.
2. A lightweight, ultra-fast, pythonic, and user-friendly robotics simulation platform.
3. A powerful and fast photo-realistic rendering system.
4. A generative data engine that transforms user-prompted natural language description into various modalities of data.

Powered by a universal physics engine re-designed and re-built from the ground up, Genesis integrates various physics solvers 
and their coupling into a unified framework. 
This core physics engine is further enhanced by a generative agent framework that operates at an upper level, 
aiming towards fully automated data generation for robotics and beyond.
Currently, it is open-sourcing the underlying physics engine and the simulation platform. 
The generative framework will be released in the near future.

Genesis is built and will continuously evolve with the following long-term missions:
1. Lowering the barrier to using physics simulations and making robotics research accessible to everyone. (See our commitment)
2. Unifying a wide spectrum of state-of-the-art physics solvers into a single framework, allowing re-creating the whole physical 
   world in a virtual realm with the highest possible physical, visual and sensory fidelity, using the most advanced simulation techniques.
3. Minimizing human effort in collecting and generating data for robotics and other domains, letting the data flywheel spin on its own.
