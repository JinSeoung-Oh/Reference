1. Origins and uptake
   -1. In 1970, Masahiro Mori proposed “bukimi no tani” (uncanny valley): familiarity rises with human-likeness, drops sharply near “almost human but imperfect,” 
       then rises again once fully human-like. Popularized after the 1978 English rendering and especially after the 2005 English translation, spurring research across HRI,
       graphics, and bio/social roots.
   -2. Quantitative accounts include Roger K. Moore’s (2012) Bayesian categorical perception at category boundaries, and Burleigh & Schoenherr’s view 
       that categorical + frequency-based processing jointly yield the effect (a general information-processing outcome rather than a sui generis phenomenon).

2. Aim of the paper
   -1. Upgrade Mori’s phenomenological curve to a mechanistic neuro-dynamic model (coupled differential equations) at the level of neuronal populations, 
       explaining, simulating, and generalizing the dynamics to broader domains (pathogen avoidance, mate choice signals, mortality salience, identity threats, cue discord).

3. Psychoanalytic lineage
   -1. The “uncanny” is historically tied to Jentsch’s intellectual uncertainty and Freud’s heimlich/unheimlich duality; 
       Lacan treats the uncanny as a via regia into anxiety where the “real” ruptures symbolic order. The paper reframes this through a Bayesian predictive coding lens
      (priors vs. mismatching evidence).

4. Mechanistic model
   -1. State variables: R (human-likeness, slow), H(R) (familiarity), E(R) (eeriness), all normalized to [0,1].
   -2. Rates: k₁(R) (familiarity growth), k₂(R) (eeriness generation), k₃(R) (eeriness decay); F(R)=H−E defines the uncanny curve.
   -3. Default (quasi-)Markov assumption; memory and noise can be added via non-Markov or stochastic extensions.

5. Kinetic underpinnings
   -1. Sigmoid (logistic) dynamics for k₁, k₃: threshold–saturation behavior from neuronal population responses and psychological habituation. 
                                               Implemented via resource-limited catalyst populations consuming a pool → logistic ODE → sigmoid solutions.
   -2. Gaussian dynamics for k₂: aggregate of many small conflicting cues (appearance, motion, texture, timing) yields a Gaussian spike around R₀ (near-human locus),
                                 consistent with neural tuning curves and Bayesian prediction-error surges (free-energy minimization framing).

6. Simulations
   -1. Initial example: H₀=0, E₀=0. Two cases: moving agent (robot) vs still entity (toy) with parameter tweaks.
   -2. Findings: The model reproduces the valley (H↑, E peaks, F=H−E dips then recovers). Motion steepens slopes and deepens the valley. 
                 Cross-plot comparability via scaling α=2. Shapes qualitatively match Mori’s original curve.

7. Design levers, predictions, tests
   -1. Levers: micro-jitter/phase asynchrony → narrower/higher k₂ (deeper valley); structured pre-exposure → higher k₁, k₃ (shallower valley). 
               Strategy options: stylize (stay pre-valley), accelerate realism (cross R₀ fast), pre-expose users.
   -2. Parameter semantics/measurement: k₂ amplitude ≈ prior precision; k₃ ceiling ≈ habituation capacity; estimable via psychophysics + physiology (GSR, pupil, HRV).
   -3. Testable hypotheses: pre-exposure reduces depth; prototypical priming deepens it; removing a conflicting channel widens σ and lowers k₂ peak; 
                            motion coherence smooths the negative-slope region.

8. Generalization
   -1. Same state–kinetic template applies to pathogen/disgust avoidance, identity threat/mortality salience, mate-choice cue discord—by reinterpreting R and tuning k’s.

9. Bottom line
   -1. The uncanny valley emerges from the competition between sigmoid habituation/affinity (k₁, k₃) and a Gaussian, prediction-error–driven eeriness surge (k₂) 
       near a Bayesian category boundary.
   -2. This mechanistic account matches Mori’s curve, explains motion effects, yields actionable controls for design/rollout, and generalizes across “uncanny-class” phenomena.
