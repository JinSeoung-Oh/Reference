Frames, or coordinate frames, are essentially reference systems used to describe the position and orientation of objects 
(such as robot links, joints, or the end-effector) in space. 
They are foundational in robotics for several reasons:

1. Defining Positions and Orientations:
   A frame is defined by an origin (a point in space) and a set of axes (usually orthogonal, such as x, y, and z axes). 
   Any point in space can be described in terms of its coordinates with respect to a given frame.

2. Attaching Frames to Robot Links and Joints:
   -1. Link Frames: Each link of a robot typically has its own frame. This helps in describing the link’s position and orientation relative 
                    to a fixed base frame or to the previous link in the kinematic chain.
   -2. Joint Frames: At the joints, frames are also defined to capture how one link moves relative to the other
                     (e.g., rotational or translational movement).

3. Transformations Between Frames:
   -1. To understand the robot's overall configuration, you need to know how to convert coordinates from one frame to another. 
       This is where homogeneous transformation matrices come into play.
   -2. For example, if you have a frame attached to the robot's base and another attached to the end-effector, 
       the transformation between these frames tells you the end-effector’s position and orientation relative to the base.

4. Usage in Forward and Inverse Kinematics:
   -1. Forward Kinematics: Involves using a sequence of frame transformations (often defined by Denavit-Hartenberg parameters) 
                           to determine the position and orientation of the end-effector frame relative to the base frame.
   -2. Inverse Kinematics: Uses the known desired end-effector frame and works backward through the chain of frames to compute the necessary
                           joint variables.

5. Visualization and Analysis:
   -1. Frames help visualize the robot's structure. When you see a robot model, you often see little coordinate axes attached 
       to each link—these are the frames.
   -2. They allow us to analyze the robot's motion and behavior in a mathematically rigorous way.
