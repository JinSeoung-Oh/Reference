1. Overview (Introduction)
   -a. This paper extends the author’s prior work, “Exploring Clustered Optimal Policies via Off-Policy RL,” by investigating Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
       — a critic-free reinforcement learning algorithm that uses group-and-action-based baselines instead of a value critic.
   -b. Unlike PPO/A2C, GRPO is lightweight, stable, and fast, as it removes the critic network entirely while still supporting multiple objectives 
       (e.g., profit, fairness, brand tone) with a single unified policy.
   -c. The paper has three main goals:
       -1. Present GRPO as a lightweight alternative to PPO for grouped or clustered business data.
       -2. Apply GRPO to a real business use case — coupon policy personalization.
       -3. Extend GRPO with two innovations:
           -1) Cluster-Adaptive GRPO: Adds expert heads + a lightweight gate, boosting IPS ROI from 0.08 to 0.96.
           -2) Transformer-GRPO: Replaces the MLP encoder with a state–action transformer, achieving an IPS ROI of 3.78.

2. Core Concepts of GRPO
   -a. Policy Gradient Perspective
       -1. Two major families in RL:
           -1) Value-based (e.g., DQN): Learn Q(s,a) → derive policy by argmax.
           -2) Policy-gradient (e.g., REINFORCE): Optimize π_θ(a|s) directly using ∇θJ(θ), optionally using baselines for variance reduction.
       -2. GRPO aligns with the REINFORCE-style policy-gradient method, using a non-parametric baseline per (group, action) pair.
   -b. GRPO Mechanism      
       -1. Critic-free: Only the actor π_θ(a|s) is trained.
       -2. Maintains a lookup table baseline b_{g,a} per group and action (e.g., coupon amount).
       -3. Baseline is updated via an exponential moving average with upward clamping (only increases).
       -4. Update rule:
           -1) Δ = R - b_{g,a}
           -2) loss = −(logπθ(a|s) * Δ) − β * entropy

3. GRPO Algorithm Summary
   -a. Initialization:
       -1. Cluster feature vectors via BGMM → assign c_i.
       -2. Randomly initialize π_θ.
       -3. Set b[k,a] = 0 for all (cluster, action) pairs.
   -b. Training Loop:
       -1. Sample a minibatch (s_i, a_i, r_i, c_i).
       -2. Compute Δ_i = r_i − b[c_i, a_i]
       -3. Update π_θ with REINFORCE loss.
       -4. Update b[c_i, a_i] = max(prev, EMA with α).

4. Why GRPO Matters in Business
   -a. Customer logs are often imbalanced, with sparse rewards and high noise.
   -b. PPO's critic can overfit under sparse feedback.
   -c. GRPO asks a simpler question: “How has this coupon performed for similar customers?”
   -d. Group-based baselines enable efficient and stable learning without added complexity.

5. Extension 1: Cluster-Adaptive GRPO
   -a. Key Idea 
       -1. Assign a separate expert policy head to each customer cluster.
       -2. Use a gating network to route customers to the appropriate head.
       -3. Each head is warm-started with supervised learning using its own cluster’s logs.
   -b. Training Components
       -1. Each head k is updated with REINFORCE using samples from cluster k.
       -2. Gate network γ_ϕ(s) is trained using:
           -1) A policy-gradient term based on log-probability of choosing the correct segment.
           -2) A cross-entropy loss comparing gate outputs with BGMM labels.
           -3) Total gate loss: L_pg + λ * L_ce (λ ≈ 0.2)

6. Extension 2: Transformer-GRPO
   -a. Key Idea
       -1. MLP is limited in capturing complex interactions between features and actions.
       -2. Replace MLP with a Transformer encoder, treating each coupon as a learnable token and jointly encoding (state + action) interactions.
       -3. This allows detection of conditional effects, like "$6 off" only being effective on weekends.
   -b. Training Process
       -1. Still critic-free.
       -2. Advantage = r − r̄ (batch mean).
       -3. REINFORCE loss with entropy bonus.
       -4. Steps:
           -1) Warm-up buffer with random policy.
           -2) Sample (s, a, r) triples from buffer.
           -3) Encode state-action tokens with Transformer → logits.
           -4) Compute advantage and REINFORCE loss.
           -5) Backprop through actor and Transformer.
           -6) Append 400 on-policy samples, repeat.

7. Experimental Results
   Method	 | First 10 Actions	| IPS ROI
   A. Pure GRPO	| [0 0 0 ...]	| 0.08
   B. Cluster-Adaptive GRPO	| [2 2 2 ...]	| 0.96
   C. Transformer-GRPO	| [0 0 0 ...]	| 3.78

   -a. Method A (single head): Chooses conservative $0 coupon across all segments; misses profit potential.
   -b. Method B: Adds cluster-specific heads and gate → substantial profit gain.
   -c. Method C: Uses Transformer to automatically discover soft segments and fine-grained interactions → highest ROI, though less interpretable.

8. Final Thoughts
   -a. GRPO proves that critic-free RL can work in real-world business environments.
   -b. Stepwise recommendation:
       -1. Start with basic GRPO and group-based baselines.
       -2. Add specialized heads + gating (Cluster-Adaptive GRPO).
       -3. Use Transformer when segments are fuzzy or overlapping (Transformer-GRPO).
   -c. Future directions:
       -1. Build mixture-of-experts architectures with modular heads (e.g., pricing, upselling).
       -2. Incorporate adaptive clustering and multi-objective RL.
       -3. Position GRPO as a general-purpose real-time policy engine for personalized decision making.
