1. Representation in Computational Thinking
   Representation refers to the models we build to simplify and understand processes, rules, and datasets. 
   Examples include grids for Scrabble (15x15), chess (8x8), or more complex structures like a DAWG (Directed Acyclic Word Graph) for storing dictionaries efficiently.
   Representation helps organize and document information to make sense of complex systems, be it in board games or algorithms.

   The text emphasizes that understanding how to build a model is crucial for making sense of data. 
   In the context of this course, representation and model-building are seen as essential skills for computational thinking.
   The course explores these ideas from various perspectives, pushing students to go beyond surface-level understanding.

2. The Framework for Model Building
   Model building involves the following four key components that help understand and predict how a system behaves

   -1. Data
       In this case, data comes from the State Bank of Pakistan's (SBP) Payment Systems Dataset, covering 31 quarters from 2016 to 2024. 
       Understanding how the data is generated (the “generator function”) is critical to interpreting it correctly.
   -2. Assumptions
       These include both explicit (like a 0.1% bank fee on mobile transactions) and implicit (like applying national age 
       and income distributions to mobile banking customers) assumptions. Assumptions help fill gaps where direct data isn't available.
   -3. Relationships
       This involves understanding both explicit relationships (like column relationships in data) and implicit ones
       (like the effect of exchange rates on eCommerce sales). 
       Identifying relationships between variables (e.g., mobile banking fees, customer distribution, exchange rates) is key for feature extraction 
       and forecasting future behavior.
   -4. Questions
       Questions define the purpose of the model. These could range from understanding how the data works (relationships), forecasting (trend lines), 
       or calculating probabilities (distributions). The questions direct how the model is structured and what answers it needs to produce.

3. Representation Challenges
   Building models in an unstructured environment is difficult because it requires filtering signal from noise, figuring out what matters, 
   and then using that information to answer specific questions. 
   For example, understanding income distribution by age bracket is different from age distribution by income bracket, 
   and knowing which one to use depends on the question.

   The dataset used for the midterm forces students to engage in unstructured model building, where they must figure out how to start, what data to focus on,
   and how to extract meaningful insights without explicit instructions. This is crucial for learning real-world problem-solving skills.

4. Two Hats, Four Lenses
   The text suggests two approaches when working with datasets
   -1. Representation: Understanding the context and generating distributions to simplify data.
   -2. Signal Compression: Filtering noise to focus only on the useful information needed to answer specific questions.
   
   Additionally, four lenses are used to analyze the data:
   -1. First Order: Presents information as it is.
   -2. Second Order Change: Looks at trends or changes over time.
   -3. Distributions: Analyzes patterns of change or behavior.
   -4. Trend Lines: Forecasts future behavior.

5. Training vs. Inference
   The process of model building involves two cycles:
   -1. Training Cycle: This involves pre-work, lectures, and exercises to build the “map” of how data works.
   -2. Inference Cycle: This is where the map is used to answer questions, similar to how large language models perform inference after being trained.

6. Types of Questions in Model Building
   -1. Relationship Questions: How do things work? For example, how are mobile banking fees generated?
   -2. Prediction Questions: What is likely to happen in the future? For example, what is the forecast for mobile banking revenue next quarter?
   -3. Distribution Questions: What is the probability of an event? For example, what's the likelihood of a certain outcome in eCommerce growth?
   -4. Trend Questions: How will things change over time? This involves building trend lines and using them for forecasts.

7. Why the Exercise Is Challenging
   -1. Unfamiliar Territory
       Many students haven't engaged in unstructured model building before, making it a tough shift from being given data with 
       clear steps to processing raw datasets with multiple variables.
   -2. Noise Filtering
       This dataset contains noise, and students must figure out which pieces of information are important to focus on.
   -3. No Step-by-Step Guide
       Unlike a structured task like building a LEGO set, this exercise requires students to determine their own path to understanding the data.

8. The Intent of the Exercise
   -1. Building Comfort with Representation and Modeling
       The goal is to get students familiar with the model-building process and representation, 
       emphasizing that good representation is a key skill in computational thinking.
   -2. Collaboration and Future Steps
       This task prepares students for the next stage, such as building a 16-bit CPU, by pushing them to collaborate and think in systems.
   -3. Seeing the World Systematically
       Ultimately, the exercise helps students view the world like a system where all parts interact. 
       This is akin to understanding how large language models or search engines map the world.

9. Conclusion
   The key takeaway is that while models are approximations of reality, they are functional tools that help us understand, predict, and answer real-world questions.
   The challenge of representation and model building lies in moving from abstract concepts to hands-on application, 
   where students must not only manage data but also understand the relationships between variables to draw meaningful conclusions.
