Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a technique used in developing question answering systems 
that can retrieve information from external sources and use it to generate responses. 
It combines the strengths of retrieval-based and generation-based models, enabling it to generalize well across various questions and domains.

However, as RAG systems advance, they face certain limitations:

1. Reasoning Abilities
   More complex questions require reasoning beyond simple text matching. RAG systems need to understand multifaceted questions, 
   identify relevant information, and perform multi-step inferences to arrive at answers. Current RAG systems often have limited reasoning abilities, 
   restricting the types of questions they can handle.

2. Context Usage
   RAG systems rely on contextual information from various documents to generate responses. 
   However, encoding and reasoning over extensive contexts is challenging. 
   Current approaches often fail to use retrieved context optimally, limiting the expansion of knowledge.

To address these limitations, recent innovations have focused on specialized language model fine-tuning:

1. Reinforced Fine-Tuning (ReFT) is a technique that uses reinforcement learning to explore multiple reasoning paths for problem-solving. 
   It helps language models generalize better and understand diverse reasoning approaches.

2. Reasoning on Graphs (RoG) is another approach that uses structured knowledge graphs to improve reasoning capabilities. 
   It teaches language models to traverse graphs and derive non-explicit solutions.

3. Long Context Fine-Tuning focuses on enhancing models' ability to reason over long document contexts. 
   It enables models to encode larger volumes of external information and make coherent inferences.

These specialized fine-tuning techniques have shown promising results in overcoming reasoning and context limitations, 
making RAG systems more capable of handling complex questions in real-world applications.
