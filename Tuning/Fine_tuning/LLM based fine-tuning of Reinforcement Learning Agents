1. Introduction
   This article discusses the concept of agentic AI—intelligent systems that can independently execute tasks—and positions it relative to current trends 
   in generative AI (Gen AI). 
   While much attention has focused on LLM-based agents for natural language processing tasks, 
   the text underscores that some tasks may be better suited to other machine learning techniques, such as reinforcement learning (RL).

   A reference architecture for agentic AI platforms is presented, highlighting the need for an orchestration layer that decomposes tasks into sub-tasks 
   and executes them via specialized agents. 
   However, these systems currently rely heavily on large language models (LLMs) for reasoning, and their performance is thus limited by LLM capabilities.
   Memory management and integration with enterprise systems (e.g., CRMs) are also important components. 
   The main focus of the article is to explore how LLMs can refine RL agent rewards and policies, thereby integrating RL more closely into the agentic AI landscape.

2. AI Agents and Limitations of LLM Agents
   AI agents today are often synonymous with LLM agents: systems prompted to perform NLP tasks such as document processing, summarization, and retrieval.
   However, certain tasks—particularly those involving continuous decision-making or control—may benefit from RL approaches rather than just LLM-based methods. 
   For instance, tasks that require dynamic adaptation, optimization, and real-time control can be better handled by RL agents.

3. Reinforcement Learning for Industrial Control Systems
   The article then introduces reinforcement learning (RL) as a suitable paradigm for controlling complex systems like those found in manufacturing 
   and industrial settings. RL agents learn optimal policies through trial and error, guided by a reward function that incentivizes desirable outcomes. 
   This approach has become popular in tackling problems ranging from robotic arms in factories to air conditioning (HVAC) controls in buildings.

   -a. Limitations of Traditional Control Theory:
       -1. Traditional control systems rely on model-driven control, focusing on solving linear equations.
       -2. Real-world systems are often non-linear, making linear models inadequate or overly complex to derive.
       -3. Some systems are too complex or unknown to model precisely.
       -4. Simulation of large-scale, non-linear systems is difficult, limiting the applicability of classic control theory.

   -b. Why ML/RL Helps:
       -1. ML, especially RL, does not require explicit system modeling. Instead, it can learn patterns from data, even for complex, non-linear systems.
       -2. RL’s reward-driven approach lets it adapt to real-time changes, making it an effective solution for many control problems where classical methods struggle.

4. RL Agents and LLM Integration
   The text highlights that while RL is powerful, integrating LLMs can further refine RL policies. 
   One way is by having LLMs assist in designing or fine-tuning the RL reward functions. 
   This pairing leverages LLM’s generative and reasoning capabilities to improve the reward signals that guide RL training.

   -a. Observation:
       -1. RL rewards and policies are separate functions. The RL agent aims to maximize rewards, 
           but the nature of the reward function greatly influences the final policy.
       -2. LLMs can help explore different reward configurations, identifying more optimal reward structures to achieve desired behaviors in RL agents.

5. LLM-Based Fine-Tuning of RL Reward Functions
   The article proposes a method where LLMs and RL are brought together to improve RL reward and policy functions. The steps include:

   -a. Initial Prompt to LLM:
       Provide the LLM with the RL problem scenario and initial reward/policy structure.

   -b. Generate Candidate Reward Functions:
       The LLM generates new reward function candidates, guided by a “temperature” setting that balances novelty and reliability.

   -c. Validate and Evaluate:
       Check the generated reward functions against the use-case accuracy and relevance.

   -d. Memory Update:
       Store the results of each iteration back into the LLM’s memory so it can learn from previous attempts.

   -e. Repeat Until Convergence:
       Keep refining and evaluating until an improved reward function is found.

   -f. Adopt the Best Reward Function:
       Once a top-performing reward function emerges, update the RL agent to use it.

6. Practical Example: HVAC Optimization
   A concrete use-case is discussed: optimizing HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) systems in buildings using RL. 
   Here, RL replaces legacy PID controllers, aiming to reduce energy consumption while maintaining comfort.

   -a. Scenario:
       -1. Sensors measure indoor/outdoor temperature and humidity.
       -2. Actuators (valves) control cooling, heating, re-heating, and humidification.
       -3. The RL agent must learn how much to open these valves under various conditions to minimize energy use without violating comfort thresholds.

   -b. Reward Function: A reward function can combine parameters like:
       -1. Setpoint Closeness (SC): Encourages maintaining temperature/humidity near the desired setpoint.
       -2. Energy Cost (EC): Penalizes excessive energy usage.
       -3. Tolerance Violation (TV): Strongly penalizes going out of acceptable comfort bounds.

   By applying the LLM-based reward fine-tuning, different policies can be tried:
   -1. A “safe” policy with high penalty for violation, ensuring comfort at high energy cost.
   -2. A “business first” policy that prioritizes staying near setpoints.
   -3. An “energy optimal” policy that reduces consumption even if it relaxes other criteria slightly.

7. Conclusion
   In a world where AI agents are often equated with LLM-based NLP tasks, this article illustrates that other agentic tasks—like industrial control—benefit 
   from different ML approaches. RL, in particular, shines for control optimization scenarios. 
   By leveraging LLMs to fine-tune RL reward functions, one can further refine and optimize these RL agents.

   The outlined methodology and example (HVAC optimization) showcase the promise of combining LLMs with RL, 
   potentially extending to a broad spectrum of RL-driven agentic tasks.
