As large language models (LLMs) grow in size, the cost of fine-tuning the entire model becomes increasingly prohibitive. 
To tackle this issue, the text introduces a Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method 
called Principal Singular values and Singular vectors Adaptation (PiSSA). 
PiSSA optimizes a smaller subset of parameters while maintaining or exceeding the performance of full-model fine-tuning.

1. Key Concepts
   - PiSSA is inspired by Intrinsic SAID, which suggests that pre-trained, over-parametrized models reside in a space of low intrinsic dimension. 
     This allows the model to be effectively fine-tuned by focusing on the most essential components.

   - PiSSA's Methodology: It represents a weight matrix 𝑊 as the product of two trainable matrices 𝐴 and 𝐵, plus a residual matrix 
     𝑊^(𝑟𝑒𝑠) for error correction. The weight matrix 𝑊 is factorized using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), 
     where the principal singular values and vectors are used to initialize 𝐴 and 𝐵. The residual singular values and vectors initialize 
     𝑊^(𝑟𝑒𝑠), which remains frozen during fine-tuning.

2. Comparison to LoRA
   - LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) also uses two matrices, 𝐴 and 𝐵, but initializes them differently—𝐴 with Gaussian noise and 𝐵 with zeros, 
     while keeping the original matrix frozen. LoRA approximates the weight changes (Δ𝑊) through the product of these matrices.

   - PiSSA's advantage lies in initializing 𝐴 and 𝐵 with principal components from the original matrix 𝑊, 
     which allows it to focus on the most impactful parts of the model, while freezing the "noisy" components. 
     This allows faster convergence and better performance than LoRA, which updates "noise" from the beginning.

3. Benefits of PiSSA:
   - Same Architecture as LoRA
     PiSSA inherits LoRA’s advantages, including parameter efficiency and compatibility with quantization.
   - Fast Initialization
     By using a fast SVD method, PiSSA’s initialization takes only a few seconds, making the transition from LoRA to PiSSA seamless and
     with minimal computational cost.

In summary, PiSSA offers a more efficient and faster fine-tuning approach by leveraging principal singular values and vectors to focus on the critical parts of the model, leading to faster convergence and better overall performance than LoRA while maintaining a similar architecture.
