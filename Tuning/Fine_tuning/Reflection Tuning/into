Reflection Tuning is a recent development in Generative AI that has made the Llama 3.1 70B model the best open-sourced model through Fine-Tuning.
Fine-tuning is the process of adapting pre-trained language models to specific tasks by training them on smaller, specialized datasets.

Reflection Fine-Tuning is an enhanced form of fine-tuning, where the model reasons through a query, detects mistakes, corrects itself, 
and then provides the final response. 
The model uses specific tags such as <thinking>, <reflection>, and <output> to organize its reasoning, error detection, correction, and final answer.

For example, when asked “what is 2+2?”, the model reasons that the answer is 5 but corrects itself within the <reflection> tags, realizing the correct answer is 4. 
This method has made significant improvements, such as making Llama 3.1 70B the best model, and it can be applied to other LLMs using platforms like unsloth.
