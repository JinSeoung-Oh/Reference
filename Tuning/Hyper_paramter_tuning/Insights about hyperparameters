1. Learning rate: Learning rate is crucial, as indicated by Shapley values, and higher values lead to quicker convergence but may miss optimal results. 
                  Lower learning rates are favored for better performance, even though it requires more iterations. 
                  It interacts significantly with the number of estimators.

2. Max depth: Controls the maximum depth of each tree, with too high values leading to overfitting and too low values leading to underfitting.

3. Colsample_by_tree: Determines the ratio of features to sample for each new tree. 
                      Lower sampling rates work better with lower learning rates, promoting stability in learning from each additional tree.

4. N_estimators: The number of trees in boosting algorithm, where more trees generally lead to better performance.
                 Interacts significantly with learning rate; higher learning rates are better with fewer estimators,
                 and lower learning rates are favored with more estimators.

5. Subsample: The ratio of training data to sample before training a tree. Its impact varies with datasets, 
              with higher subsampling favored in one dataset and the opposite in another. Interaction with learning rate is notable.

6. Min_child_weight: Controls instance weight needed in a child, affecting split and overfitting. 
                     Its importance varies with datasets, and high values consistently decrease performance in the Titanic dataset.

7. Gamma: Represents the minimum loss reduction needed to split a tree, which seems to be less impactful across both datasets. 
          It could potentially be dropped to reduce the search space for optimal solutions.
