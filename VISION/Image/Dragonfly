## From https://www.together.ai/blog/dragonfly-v1

# Key Announcements
  -1. Launch of Dragonfly Architecture
      A breakthrough vision-language architecture that enhances fine-grained visual understanding and reasoning about image regions.

# Model Releases:
  -1. Llama-3-8b-Dragonfly-v1: A general-domain model trained on 5.5 million image-instruction pairs.
  -2. Llama-3-8b-Dragonfly-Med-v1: Finetuned on an additional 1.4 million biomedical image-instruction data.

# Performance
  -1. Visual Question Answering and Image Captioning
      - Dragonfly shows promising performance on general vision-language benchmarks.
  -2. Medical Image Processing
      - Dragonfly-Med outperforms Med-Gemini on multiple medical imaging tasks, excelling in high-resolution medical data.

# Image Embedding Strategies
  -1. Multi-resolution Visual Encoding
      - Processes images at low, medium, and high resolutions.
      - Each image, depending on its resolution, is divided into sub-images and encoded into visual tokens projected into a language space.
  -2. Zoom-in Patch Selection
      - For high-resolution images, Dragonfly uses a strategy to select high-resolution sub-images that provide the most significant visual information.
      - Compares summary embeddings of medium and high-resolution sub-images to select the most semantically relevant patches.

# Case Studies
  -1. General Domain
      - Example 1: Description of a skateboarder performing a trick in a vibrant skatepark.
      - Example 2: Diagram illustrating photosynthesis in plants and the associated solar body.

  -2. Medical Domain
      - Example 1: Detailed radiology note based on a chest X-ray.
      - Example 2: Description of an abdominal CT scan and a spleen affected by chronic myelogenous leukemia.

# Benchmark Performance
  -1. Vision-Language Benchmarks
      - Dragonfly demonstrated competitive performance on AI2D, ScienceQA, MMMU, MMVet, and POPE benchmarks.
  -2. Medical Data Benchmarks
      - Dragonfly-Med achieved state-of-the-art performance on VQA-RAD, SLAKE, and Path-VQA datasets.

# Conclusion and Future Directions
  -1. Extracting Fine-grained Visual Information
      - Dragonfly efficiently extracts detailed visual information from image regions.
  -2. Open Source Multimodal Research
      - The release of Dragonfly aims to encourage the research community to explore multimodal research and apply AI to real-world problems.
  -3. Future Research
      - Plans include exploring new architectures, better visual encoding strategies, and comprehensive studies on data mixtures to benefit broader scientific fields.
