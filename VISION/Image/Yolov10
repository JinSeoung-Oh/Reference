1. YOLO Network Structure
   YOLO networks consist of three main parts
   -1. Backbone: Acts as a feature extractor using classification models.
   -2. Neck: Aggregates feature maps from different stages of the backbone.
   -3. Head: Detects object regions but does not identify specific objects. It includes two-stage and one-stage detectors, 
           further divided into anchor-based and anchor-free detectors.

2. YOLOv10 Goals
   YOLOv10 aims to enhance performance and efficiency by:
   -1. Eliminating NMS, introducing consistent dual assignments for NMS-free training, achieving competitive performance and low inference latency.
   -2. Holistically optimizing YOLO components for efficiency and accuracy, reducing computational overhead and enhancing capability.

3. Removing Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS)
   NMS involves selecting the proposal with the highest confidence, removing overlapping proposals based on an Intersection over Union (IOU) threshold, 
   and repeating the process. This process adds overhead, particularly in real-time settings. 
   YOLOv10 eliminates NMS, instead using dual label assignments combining one-to-one and one-to-many assignments for better supervision and accuracy.

4. Spatial-Channel Decoupled Downsampling
   Standard convolutional neural networks (CNNs) like VGG16 scale features across spatial dimensions and channels, but YOLOv10 decouples these operations
   to reduce computational cost and retain more information. It uses pointwise convolution for channel modulation and depthwise convolution for spatial downsampling, 
   resulting in significant efficiency improvements.

5. Rank-Guided Block Design
   YOLOv10 analyzes redundancy in different stages of the network, suggesting that using the same block design throughout is suboptimal. 
   It introduces a rank-guided block design scheme, employing a compact inverted block (CIB) structure to decrease complexity in redundant stages,
   enhancing efficiency without compromising performance.

6. Lightweight Classification Head
   The classification head determines object classes and calculates probabilities, while the regression head predicts bounding box coordinates and confidence scores. 
   YOLOv10 reduces the overhead of the classification head, using a lightweight architecture that maintains performance.

7. Accuracy-Driven Model Design
   YOLOv10 uses large-kernel depthwise convolutions in deep stages to enhance the receptive field and model capability,
   employing structural reparameterization to optimize without inference overhead. Large-kernel convolutions are only used for small-model scales 
   to balance efficiency and performance.

8. Partial Self-Attention (PSA)
   YOLOv10 incorporates an efficient partial self-attention (PSA) module, partitioning features into two parts and applying self-attention to one part 
   to reduce computational complexity. This enhances global representation learning with low computational costs, improving overall model performance.

9. Results
   YOLOv10 shows significant improvements in latency and performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of its design and optimization strategies.
