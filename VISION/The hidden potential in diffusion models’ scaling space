1. Introduction & Motivation
   -a. Diffusion models are powerful for image generation/editing, but their scaling space—the way noise predictions are scaled—remains underexplored.
   -b. Current models use a single scalar (ω) to scale the guidance direction (Δϵ), which blends both low-frequency (structure/layout) 
       and high-frequency (texture/detail) components.
   -c. FreSca proposes frequency-aware scaling, independently scaling different frequency bands (low & high) to enhance editing precision
       and generalization in both image editing and image understanding (like depth estimation).

2. How Diffusion Models Work (Baseline Understanding)
   -a. A diffusion model generates images by gradually denoising a noise vector using a denoising model 𝜖_𝜃
   -b. There are two types of noise predictions:
       -1. Conditional (on a text prompt)
       -2. Unconditional (no prompt)
   -c. Their difference Δ𝜖=𝜖_(cond)−𝜖_(uncond) reflects the semantic effect of the prompt.
   -d. This Δϵ is scaled by a factor 𝜔 to control edit intensity.

3. Limitations of Vanilla Scaling
   -a. Global scalar (ω) affects all frequencies the same way, mixing coarse layout and fine texture control.
   -b. Makes it hard to perform precise edits (e.g., shape vs. style tweaks).
   -c. No awareness of how different frequencies behave during denoising:
       -1. Early steps affect structure
       -2. Late steps refine details

4. FreSca: Frequency-Aware Scaling
   -a. Key Idea:
       -1. Move to the Fourier domain and independently scale:
           -1) Low-frequency components (structure, layout)
           -2) High-frequency components (edges, texture)
   -b. Steps:  
       -1. Decompose Δ𝜖 into low- and high-frequency components via Fourier Transform.
       -2. Apply independent scaling factors:
           -𝑙 for low frequencies
           -ℎ for high frequencies
       -3. Reconstruct the scaled noise via Inverse Fourier Transform.
       -4. Plug this modified guidance back into the diffusion denoising process.
   -c. Control Mechanism:  
       -1. Adjusting 𝑙 enhances or suppresses structure-related edits.
       -2. Adjusting ℎ enhances or suppresses fine details and contours.

5. Benefits
   -a. No retraining required: Works as a plug-in in existing pipelines.
   -b. More precise control over edits by decoupling structure vs. texture influence.
   -c. Generalizable: Can improve depth estimation and other vision tasks beyond editing.

6. Applications
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   
1. Image Editing
   -1. Integrated FreSca into training-free methods like LEdits++ and DDPM Inversion.
   -2. FreSca modifies only the forward diffusion process—no change to denoising model.
   
  -a. Evaluation:
      -1. Used TEdBench (40 images × editing prompts).
      -2. Metrics:
          - CLIP-text score: measures alignment with prompt.
          - FID-30k: evaluates image realism.
      -3. Also used InternVL2.5–8B (VLM) for binary success judgment and quality scoring.
  -b. Result:
      -1. FreSca significantly improves both metrics across baselines.
      -2. Visuals show more coherent edits and better fidelity to target prompts.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
2. Depth Estimation
   -1. Applied FreSca to:
       -1) Marigold: monocular depth estimation model
       -2) ChronoDepth: video depth estimation
   -2. Used frequency scaling during noise prediction to enhance fine geometry and edge detail.
   -3. Achieved better depth maps, especially in complex regions with high-frequency structures.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

7. Analysis and Ablation
   -a. Low-frequency scale 𝑙:
       -1. Acts like ω; larger 𝑙 → stronger semantic editing.
   -b. High-frequency scale ℎ:
       -1. ℎ>1: enhances fine detail & contour.
       -2. ℎ<1: suppresses noise or restores original shape.
   -c. Shows that FreSca gives independent control unlike prior methods that entangle them.

8. Why It Works: Theoretical Insight
   -a. Fourier analysis reveals:
       -1. Early steps affect low-frequency structures.
       -2. Later steps affect high-frequency textures.
   -b. FreSca aligns the scaling method with this natural progression of diffusion models.

9. Broader Implications
   -a. FreSca introduces a new dimension of control: frequency-domain guidance in diffusion.
   -b. Scalable & low-cost: minimal code changes, no retraining.
   -c. Universally applicable to any denoising diffusion model.

10. Conclusion
    -a. FreSca is a general-purpose, training-free frequency-aware scaling technique.
    -b. It enhances both image editing and understanding (depth) by decoupling guidance across frequency bands.
    -c. Opens new research directions in Fourier-guided diffusion control, offering stronger editing quality and new use-case potential.
