## What is TTS (Text-to-Speech)?
   A computer program that converts written text into spoken words.
   Uses natural language processing to understand the text and convert it into speech that sounds like a person talking.
   Used in smartphone assistants, GPS navigation, and tools that help people with disabilities.


# Open-Source TTS Engines:

1. MaryTTS:
   - Adaptability: Modular design allows for building custom TTS systems and creating new voices using recordings.
   - Components:
        Markup Language Parser: Deciphers special codes in the text, providing instructions for the system.
        Processor: Prepares the parsed text for conversion into speech instructions.
        Synthesizer: Generates the actual spoken output, adding natural-sounding qualities like pitch and emphasis.

2. eSpeak:
   - Pros:
      User-friendly.
      Supports many languages and voices.
      Compact size.
      Compatible with various operating systems (Windows, Linux, macOS, Android).
   - Cons:
      Lacks advanced features and customization options.
      Written in C, which might require programming knowledge for advanced use.

3. Festival:
   Developed by the University of Edinburgh.
   - Features:
       Comprehensive framework for building and experimenting with speech synthesis systems.
       Valuable for researchers and those interested in learning about TTS.
       Uses a structure resembling a tree with connected nodes, each representing different elements contributing to the final spoken output.

4. Mimic:
   Developed by Mycroft AI.
   - Approaches:
       Mimic 1: Builds upon the well-established Festival Speech Synthesis System.
       Mimic 2: Uses deep neural networks for voice synthesis, resulting in more realistic speech. 
   - Pros:
       Generates natural-sounding speech.
       Supports various languages.
   - Cons:
       Limited documentation available.

5. Mozilla TTS:
   Utilizes deep learning, specifically sequence-to-sequence models, for natural and human-like speech generation.
   - Advantages:
       Analyzes and replicates the complexities of human speech patterns more accurately.
       Smoother, more nuanced, and less robotic speech output.
       Open-source and free, fostering collaboration and innovation.

6. Tacotron 2:
   Developed by NVIDIA, this is a neural network model architecture for generating natural speech.
   - Pros:
       Synthesize speech using raw transcripts without additional prosody information.
   - Cons:
       Requires some technical knowledge to implement.

7. GTTS (Google Text-to-Speech):
   Offers a simple interface for Python users.
   Not actively maintained by Google, but still useful for basic needs with decent language support.

8. NVidia NeMo TTS:
   Leverages deep learning for high-quality speech generation.
   Backed by NVIDIA, indicating robust support.
   - Cons:
       Might have steeper setup requirements due to its use of deep learning models.
