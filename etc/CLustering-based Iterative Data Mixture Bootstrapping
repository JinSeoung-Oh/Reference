1. Summary of CLIMB: Clustering-based Iterative Data Mixture Bootstrapping
   CLIMB is an automated framework for discovering, evaluating, and refining optimal data mixtures for language model pre-training. 
   It addresses the challenge of identifying high-performing data mixtures by embedding, clustering, 
   and iteratively searching through large-scale datasets using proxy models and a performance predictor.

2. Key Contributions
   -a. Embedding-driven Data Mixing
       CLIMB eliminates the need for manual, predefined domain-specific datasets by embedding and grouping
       semantically similar data clusters, allowing for efficient domain-specific training.
   -b. Iterative Search and Refinement
       The framework introduces an iterative process that dynamically adjusts data mixtures to enhance both domain 
       relevance and diversity, while also tackling challenges associated with clustering and large-scale data filtering.
   -c. New Dataset Contributions
       -1. A filtered 1.2-trillion-token corpus grouped into 20 semantic clusters as a research playground.
       -2. A 400-billion-token high-quality dataset (ClimbMix) for efficient pretraining.

3. Framework Overview
   -a. Data Preprocessing
       Three steps are followed to prepare data:
       -1. Text Embedding
           A large dataset 𝐷^={𝐷_1,...,𝐷_𝑛} is embedded into a semantic vector space using an embedding model 
           𝑀_𝑒, producing vectors 𝐸={𝐸_1,...,𝐸_𝑛}
       -2. Embedding Clustering
           Vectors are clustered using a method like k-means into 𝐾_𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡 clusters (e.g., 1000), allowing for fine-grained grouping.
       -3. Cluster Merging
           Low-quality clusters are pruned using classifier-based quality metrics, yielding 𝐾_𝑝𝑟𝑢𝑛𝑒𝑑 clusters. 
           These are merged based on centroid distances into 𝐾_𝑒𝑛ℎ𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑑 clusters, forming the final dataset 𝐷
   -b. Iterative Bootstrapping: Mixture Weight Search
       -1. Bi-level Optimization Objective
           Given clusters 𝐷={𝐷_1,...,𝐷_𝑘}, the goal is to find optimal mixture weights 𝛼∗∈𝐴 that maximize the performance function 
           ℓ(𝛼,𝜔), where 𝜔 are model weights trained on mixture 𝛼
       -2. Predictor Approximation
           CLIMB uses a predictor 𝑓_𝜃(𝛼) to estimate ℓ(𝛼,𝜔), drastically reducing compute by training on a limited budget 𝐶
           and minimizing predictor loss 𝐿
       -3. Iterative Refinement (Bootstrapping)
           The system evolves the sampling strategy 𝑆 and predictor 𝑓_𝜃in tandem using coordinate descent:
           -1) At each iteration 𝑘, top-N promising configurations (TopN(𝑃~_𝑘) are retained.
           -2) t-SNE visualizations show how the search space becomes more refined over iterations (CLIMB-Iter1 → Iter3).
   -c. Implementation Details
       -1. Initialization
           Randomly sample configurations from 𝐴 to form 𝑆_1, train proxy models, and collect performance.
       -2. Subroutine 1 – Configuration Sampling
           At iteration 𝑘+1, rank remaining configurations by predicted performance 𝑃~_𝑘, randomly sample 
           𝑀 from top-N, and form 𝑆_(𝑘+1)
       -3. Subroutine 2 – Predictor Fitting
           Train predictor 𝑓^(𝑘+1)_𝜃 on 𝑆_(𝑘+1), then use it to update performance predictions 
           𝑃~_(𝑘+1)
       -4. These two steps are repeated for several iterations to improve both the predictor and sampling strategy, 
           ultimately selecting the best-performing configuration as the final mixture.

4. Experimental Results
   -a. Comparison with Baselines
       -1. CLIMB outperforms random mixtures (52.17%) and Regmix (53.78%) with an average accuracy of 54.83%.
       -2. On a 1B model, CLIMB achieves 60.41% average accuracy, beating all tested baselines.
   -b. Comparison with SOTA Language Models
       -1. On general reasoning benchmarks, CLIMB-trained models (350M and 1B) outperform all sub-500M and sub-1.2B models, 
           including Llama-3.2 and AMD-OLMo.
       -2. CLIMB leads by a 2.0% margin over the next best (Llama-3.2) in overall average score.

5. ClimbMix: A New Pre-training Dataset
   -a. CLIMB is applied to merge Nemotron-CC and smollm-corpus, creating a 1.2T-token corpus organized into 20 semantic clusters (ClimbLab).
   -b. CLIMB-search identifies the optimal mixture, from which a 400B-token dataset (ClimbMix) is extracted.
   -c. A 1B model trained from scratch on ClimbMix significantly outperforms models trained on existing datasets under the same token budget.

6. Conclusion
   CLIMB is a clustering-based, iterative data mixture bootstrapping framework that automates the discovery and optimization of 
   pre-training data mixtures. It leverages:
   -a. Unsupervised semantic clustering
   -b. Iterative proxy model training
   -c. Performance predictors
   This enables efficient exploration of large data composition spaces without requiring domain labels or manual curation. 
   By training with CLIMB-generated mixtures, models achieve state-of-the-art results across 12 reasoning tasks.
