1. Introduction – The Importance of Inference
   AI has evolved rapidly, especially in how models are deployed and operated in real systems. 
   At the center lies the distinction between training and inference.
   -a. Training: The process of learning patterns and optimizing weights using massive labeled datasets. 
                 It is computation-intensive, typically performed offline with GPUs/TPUs.
   -b. Inference: The process of generating predictions on new inputs with a trained model. 
                  It uses forward pass only and requires real-time or low-latency performance. 
                  Training may take hours or weeks, but inference must deliver rapid results with efficient resource usage.

2. Inference Latency Challenges (as of 2025)
   Inference latency—the time from input to output—is one of the biggest challenges, especially for LLMs and real-time applications 
   (autonomous driving, chatbots, etc.).
   -a. Computational Complexity: Transformer models incur O(n²d) cost due to self-attention.
   -b. Memory Bandwidth: Large-scale models require massive data movement, bottlenecked by memory access speed.
   -c. Network Overhead: In cloud inference, network latency and bandwidth limitations are critical.
   -d. Predictable vs. Unpredictable Delays: Batch inference allows predictable delays, but jitter or hardware contention introduces
                                             unpredictability.
   -e. Impact: Latency directly affects user experience (voice assistants), safety (autonomous cars), and costs (cloud compute).

3. Optimization Strategies
   (1) Quantization
       -a. Principle: Replaces high-precision parameters with low-precision approximations (e.g., FP32 → INT8), 
                      reducing compute and memory needs.
       -b. Types: Uniform/non-uniform quantization, Post-Training Quantization (PTQ), Quantization-Aware Training (QAT).
       -c. Trade-offs: Offers speed and cost reduction but may reduce accuracy—balance is essential. 
                       Especially valuable for LLMs and edge devices.
   (2) Pruning
       -a. Principle: Removes redundant or low-impact weights, neurons, or support vectors.
       -b. Techniques: L1 regularization, magnitude pruning, Taylor expansion, SVM pruning.
       -c. Benefits: Smaller models, faster inference, reduced overfitting, easier deployment on constrained hardware.
       -d. Risks: Over-pruning can harm accuracy.
  (3) Hardware Acceleration
      -a. GPU: Parallelized matrix/vector computation.
      -b. NPU: Neural network–specific processors.
      -c. FPGA: Configurable chips for embedded/edge use.
      -d. ASIC: Purpose-built chips with maximum efficiency.
      -e. Trends: Real-time, energy-efficient processing, spanning cloud to edge, lowering costs and carbon footprint.
