1. Introduction and Motivation
   Semantic Sentence Matching (SSM) tasks require models to discern similarities and differences between sentence pairs. 
   While Transformer-based models like BERT excel at general similarity detection using attention mechanisms, 
   they often fail to capture fine-grained differences due to the inherent limitations of softmax-based attention.

   To address these shortcomings, the paper introduces Comateformer, a novel Transformer-based model that incorporates a quasi-attention mechanism 
   to enhance semantic matching capabilities by explicitly modeling both similarities (affinities) and dissimilarities (differences).

2. Key Contributions
   -a. Novel Dual-Affinity Module:
       Simultaneously models affinities (similarities) and dissimilarities (differences) between sentence pairs, enabling nuanced comparison.
       Uses dot product for similarity and negative L1 distances for dissimilarity, enhancing fine-grained differentiation.
   -b. Compositional Attention Mechanism:
       Eliminates the softmax function, increasing the receptive field and ensuring better representation of subtle differences.
       Introduces a combined attention matrix that adaptively performs addition, subtraction, or deletion of tokens.
   -c. Integration with Pre-trained and Non-Pretrained Models:
       Enhances expressive power and captures complex relationships between sentence pairs.
       Demonstrates improvements across 10 datasets and robustness benchmarks, outperforming baseline models like BERT and RoBERTa.
  -d. Robustness Testing and Generalization:
      Achieves an average improvement of 5% in robustness tests, demonstrating superior handling of subtle transformations (e.g., antonyms, numerical changes).

3. Comateformer Modules
   -a. Dual Affinity Module
       -1. Affinity Function: Measures similarity between sentence pairs using dot product:
           𝐸(𝐴,𝐵)=FE(𝐴)⋅FE(𝐵)^𝑇 / np.root(𝑑)
           Here, FE(.) represents a parameterized function, and 𝛼 (temperature) scales the similarity scores.

       -2. Difference Function: Measures dissimilarity using negative L1 distances:
           𝑁(𝐴,𝐵)=−𝛽⋅∣∣FN(𝐴)−FN(𝐵)∣∣_1
​           Negative values act as a gating mechanism to represent dissimilarities.

   -b. Compositional Attention Mechanism
       -1. Key Features:
           -a. Replaces traditional softmax with a combined attention matrix 𝑀, which is the elementwise product of affinity (𝐸) and 
               normalized difference (𝑁) matrices.
           -b. Normalization of 𝑁: Centered and scaled to ensure values are in [0,1] using sigmoid activation.
           -c. Temperature Hyperparameters (𝛼,𝛽): Control the size of affinity and difference matrices, affecting attention pooling.

        -2. Token Update Rule:
            Each token in sentence 𝐴 traverses 𝐵, adaptively performing addition (+1), subtraction (-1), or deletion (×0).
            Similarly, tokens in 𝐵 traverse 𝐴, updating based on contextual differences.

4. Integration into Transformer Architecture
   -a. Replacement of Vanilla Attention:
       Comateformer replaces the traditional Transformer attention module with the dual-affinity module and compositional attention mechanism.
       The new attention equation becomes:
       Attention=𝑀⋅𝑉
       where 𝑀 is derived using both similarity and difference metrics.

   -b. Integration with Pre-trained Models:
       Partial replacement of multi-head attention layers (e.g., first 3 layers in BERT) with Comateformer modules to minimize disruptions to pretraining.
       Ratios of replacement: 50% in the first layer, 40% in the second, and 30% in the third.

5. Experimental Results
   -a. Model Performance on SSM Tasks
       -1. Datasets:
           Experiments conducted on 10 datasets, including paraphrase identification and natural language inference tasks.

      -2. Results:
          BERT-base + Comateformer: +1.1% accuracy improvement.
          BERT-large + Comateformer: +0.8% accuracy improvement.
          Outperforms RoBERTa-base (+1.6%) and RoBERTa-large (+0.6%), demonstrating superior semantic matching capabilities.

  -b. Robustness Testing
      -1. Dataset: TextFlint, which introduces subtle transformations like antonyms (SwapAnt) and numerical changes (SwapNum).

      -2. Findings:
          On SwapAnt, Comateformer achieves 6% higher accuracy than BERT by effectively identifying antonym-induced semantic contradictions.
          On SwapNum, Comateformer surpasses BERT by 5%, showcasing its ability to detect numerical differences.

  -c. Case Studies
      -1. Example 1:
          Sentence pairs with minor word changes (e.g., "software" vs. "hardware") are correctly classified by Comateformer due to its explicit dissimilarity modeling.
      -2. Example 2:
          Numerical changes (e.g., "from 70 to 60" vs. "from 60 to 50") are accurately detected, unlike BERT, which struggles with subtle numerical differences.

  -d. Attention Distribution Analysis
      -1. Dot Attention: Focuses on semantically related words but fails to highlight differences.
      -2. Minus Attention: Explicitly captures dissimilarities (e.g., "software" vs. "hardware").
      -3. Combined Attention: Balances focus on both similarities and differences, ensuring holistic sentence comparison.

6. Conclusion
   -a. Key Features:
       Dual-Affinity Module: Captures both affinities and dissimilarities between sentence pairs.
       Compositional Attention Mechanism: Eliminates softmax, enhancing fine-grained differentiation.

   -b. Performance Highlights:
       Consistent improvements across 10 datasets and robustness benchmarks.
       Outperforms baseline models like BERT and RoBERTa, with significant gains in robustness testing.

   -c. Implications:
       Semantic Understanding: Enhanced ability to detect subtle differences, such as antonyms and numerical changes, 
                               makes Comateformer particularly suitable for nuanced SSM tasks.
       Pretrained Model Compatibility: Seamless integration into existing Transformer architectures like BERT, enabling broader adoption.

Comateformer represents a significant advancement in semantic sentence matching, setting a new benchmark for models capable of capturing nuanced relationships 
in text pairs.
