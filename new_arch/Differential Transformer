The Differential Transformer (DIFF Transformer) is an enhancement to the traditional Transformer architecture, 
aimed at addressing inefficiencies in attention mechanisms.
In standard Transformers, attention is often allocated to irrelevant parts of the input, 
which can result in issues such as hallucinations and poor focus on relevant information. 
The DIFF Transformer tackles this problem by introducing a differential attention mechanism.

This mechanism operates by calculating two separate softmax-based attention maps and subtracting one from the other.
This subtraction effectively cancels out noise and amplifies attention on the most relevant parts of the input. This process leads to several benefits:

-1. Noise cancellation: Similar to how noise-canceling headphones work, it removes irrelevant context, making the model more efficient in processing.
-2. Sparse attention patterns: The differential approach promotes focusing only on key information.
-3. Improved in-context learning: The model becomes more accurate and robust, particularly in handling tasks like few-shot learning and long-context modeling.

Experimental results show that the DIFF Transformer outperforms traditional models, such as OpenLLaMA and StableLM, across various tasks, 
including language modeling, information retrieval, and hallucination mitigation. 
Additionally, it achieves better results with fewer parameters and less training data, making it more efficient for large-scale AI applications.

Overall, the Differential Transformer is a promising evolution in Transformer-based architectures, 
particularly for tasks requiring long-context understanding and key information retrieval
