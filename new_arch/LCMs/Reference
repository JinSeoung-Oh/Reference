MCP is a universal protocol that connects AI systems with various data sources, aiming to enhance the performance and 
utility of AI models.

1. Key Features of MCP:
   -a. Open Standard: MCP is an open-source protocol that can be used by all AI systems.
   -b. Bidirectional Connectivity: It supports secure, two-way connections between AI tools and data sources.
   -c. Universality: It can connect with a wide range of data systems such as content repositories, business tools,
                     and development environments.
   -d. Standardization: It enables integration through a single protocol without the need to develop separate connectors
                        for each data source.
2. Structure of MCP:
   Based on a client-server architecture
   -a. Host: An LLM application that initiates the connection.
   -b. Client: Maintains a one-to-one connection with the server within the host application.
   -c. Server: Provides context, tools, and prompts to the client.

3. Advantages of MCP:
   -a. Enhanced Data Accessibility: AI models can easily access various data sources.
   -b. Development Efficiency: Developers can connect to multiple data sources using a standard protocol.
   -c. Scalability: AI systems can maintain context across multiple tools and datasets, 
                    enabling the construction of more sustainable architectures.
   -d. Security: With built-in security in the protocol, there is no need to share API keys with LLM providers.
