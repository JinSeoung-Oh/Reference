1. Introduction: Questioning Neocortex‑Centric AI
   -a. Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) are overwhelmingly inspired by the human neocortex architecture, excelling at abstract reasoning,
       pattern recognition, and language generation.
   -b. The article challenges whether this is the true path to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and sets out to explore its fundamental shortcomings.
   -c. All illustrative figures were created with MidJourney or by the author.

2. Problems with Neocortex‑Focused Development
   -a. Lack of Physical Grounding: Current models learn statistical text patterns without real‑world embodiment, 
                                   leading to logical fragility and hallucinations.
   -b. Poor Continuous, Adaptive Learning: They struggle to learn and adapt in dynamic, real‑time environments.
   -c. Missing Primitive Intelligence: Key survival functions—real‑time reactivity, homeostasis, intrinsic motivation—are absent, 
                                       constituting a foundational gap.

3. Limits of Scaling Up
   -a. Resource Explosion: Increasing parameters, data, and compute requires enormous energy, specialized hardware, 
                           and vast datasets—unsustainable long‑term.
   -b. Diminishing Returns: Performance gains taper off relative to resource consumption.
   -c. Accessibility Barrier: Only a few organizations can bear the escalating costs, raising economic and environmental concerns.
   -d. Cognitive Shortcomings: Even massive models hallucinate, lack persistent memory, and only grasp surface‑level patterns.
   -e. Emerging Alternatives: Researchers investigate neuromorphic computing, spiking neural networks, and biologically inspired 
                              architectures emphasizing efficiency and adaptability.

4. The “Primal Layers” Proposal
   -a. Bottom‑Up Revolution: Instead of further scaling disembodied cortical models, build AI from primitive brain layers upward, 
                             mirroring evolutionary development.
   -b. Integrated Framework
       -1. Foundational Layer (Digital Brainstem)
           - Implements homeostatic stability and reflex loops as non‑negotiable low‑level controllers.
       -2. Motivational Layer (Digital Limbic System)
           - Provides intrinsic goal‑setting, affective valuation (amygdala), and emotional memory modulation.
       -3. Control Layer (Digital Cerebellum)
           - Enables procedural memory (skill acquisition) and predictive error correction, akin to central pattern generators (CPGs) and PID control.
       -4. Cognitive Layer (Neocortex‑Inspired)
           - Performs high‑order reasoning and language tasks, but is grounded and constrained by the underlying layers.

5. Why It’s Not Mainstream
   -a. Historical Roots: AI research emerged from symbolic reasoning and cognitive psychology, focusing on tasks like chess or translation 
                         linked to neocortical functions, overlooking primitive structures.
   -b. Modularity vs. Messiness: Repeating cortical columns scale easily once neurons are modeled, whereas brainstem and
                                 hypothalamus circuits are non‑modular, nonlinear, and harder to generalize.
   -c. Simulation Challenges: Neuromodulators (Table 1), interoception, and feedback loops are conceptually diffuse and difficult to replicate 
                              or train in silicon.

6. Ethical Considerations
   -a. Risk of Suffering: Modeling minimal consciousness could inadvertently create systems capable of suffering.
   -b. Function vs. Experience: Advocate “function without experience”—replicate adaptive behaviors 
                                (e.g., a robot recoiling from fire) without simulating subjective experience or emotions.
   -c. Ethics‑Led Engineering: Focus on bio‑inspired performance without anthropomorphism or synthetic suffering.

7. Biological Blueprint for AI
   -a. Layer 1 – Brainstem & Spinal Cord
       -1. Homeostasis Regulation: Master control loops for vital metrics (blood glucose, temperature, blood pressure).
       -2. Reflex Arcs & CPGs: Autonomous, rhythmic motor pattern generators for breathing or walking, enabling rapid, involuntary responses.
       -3. Triune Brain Context : Brainstem as the ancient “reptilian” survival core.
   -b. Layer 2 – Limbic System
       -1. Amygdala: Fast threat/salience detection and valence assignment; can hijack responses for survival advantage.
       -2. Emotional Memory: Amygdala‑hippocampus interaction tags significant events, enhancing long‑term consolidation.
       -3. Hippocampus: Forms episodic and spatial memories as a rapid cache that offloads to the cortex over time.
   -c. Layer 3 – Cerebellum
       -1. Procedural Memory: Trial‑and‑error learning for complex motor skills without conscious oversight.
       -2. Predictive Modeling & Error Correction: Builds internal body‑environment models to forecast sensory outcomes and adjust via error feedback.

8. Conclusion: Toward Truly Robust AGI
   -a. AGI demands a composite of specialized primitive modules—survival, motivation, control, cognition—rather than monolithic cortical scaling.
   -b. The Primal Layers framework promises greater grounding, adaptability, sustainability, and ethical safety by integrating biology‑inspired layers
       from the bottom up.
