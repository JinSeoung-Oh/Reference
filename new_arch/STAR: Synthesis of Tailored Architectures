1. Background and Problem Definition
   - Existing deep learning model designs are constrained by limited search spaces, simplistic design patterns, or heuristic approaches, 
     making it challenging to balance performance and efficiency.
   - Model design needs to comprehensively optimize multiple metrics, such as parameter efficiency, inference speed, and memory usage, beyond just performance.
   - To address this, the STAR framework introduces a novel optimization method that leverages Linear Input-Varying Systems (LIVs) 
     to define a new search space and optimize using evolutionary algorithms.

2. Key Contributions
   -1. Search Space Based on Linear Input-Varying Systems (LIVs)
       - LIVs are a class of operators dynamically adjusted based on inputs, generalizing operations such as attention, recurrence, and convolution.
       - This approach enables broader design possibilities and provides a more flexible and powerful design space compared to conventional methods.
   -2. Hierarchical Numerical Encoding with 'STAR Genome'
       - Model architectures are numerically encoded in a hierarchical genome format.
       - Each genome encapsulates operational units and connectivity structures, enabling systematic optimization through evolutionary algorithms.
   -3. Multi-Objective Optimization via Evolutionary Algorithms
       - Evolutionary algorithms optimize multiple metrics simultaneously, including performance, parameter count, memory usage, and inference cache size.
       - Unlike gradient-based methods, this approach effectively handles nonlinear and complex search spaces.

3. Experimental Methods
   -1. Search Space Design
       - The LIVs-based search space allows exploration of diverse operational units and connectivity patterns.
   -2. Experimental Setup and Baselines
       - The performance and efficiency of architectures designed using STAR were evaluated against optimized Transformer++ and hybrid models.
   -3. Evaluation Metrics
       - Key metrics included language modeling performance (PPL, Perplexity), parameter count, and inference cache size.

4. Experimental Results
   -1. Improved Parameter Efficiency and Quality
       - STAR-designed architectures achieved up to a 13% reduction in parameter count compared to baseline models, while maintaining or improving performance (PPL).
   -2. Inference Cache Size Optimization
       - STAR-optimized models reduced cache size by up to 37% compared to hybrid models and up to 90% compared to Transformer++ models, without compromising quality.
   -3. Scalability
       - From small-scale (125M parameters) to large-scale (1B parameters) models, STAR consistently maintained competitive performance while significantly reducing memory usage.

5. Conclusion and Significance
   -1. A New Design Paradigm: STAR combines LIVs theory and evolutionary algorithms to overcome the limitations of existing automated and manual design approaches, 
                              providing a powerful model design tool.
   -2. Efficiency and Scalability: By optimizing multiple metrics simultaneously, STAR achieves improvements in both performance and efficiency, 
                                   demonstrating effectiveness even for large-scale models.
   -3. Future Potential: This study sets a new standard for search space design and optimization methods in AutoML and AI model development, 
                         highlighting its potential for diverse deployment scenarios.
