"""
XNet (CompleXNet) is a novel neural network architecture based on the Cauchy Integral Theorem, 
leveraging a unique Cauchy Activation Function to improve upon traditional models like Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) and Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs).

1. Key Features of XNet
   -1. Cauchy Activation Function:
       -a. Defined with trainable parameters ùúÜ_1, ùúÜ_2, and ùëë.
       -b. Exhibits a localized property, where outputs decay at both ends, allowing focus on nearby data points while ignoring distant ones.
       -c. Proven to approximate any smooth function to its highest possible order.
 
   -2. Simplified Architecture:
       Retains MLP-like structure but uses the Cauchy Activation Function, reducing the depth or number of nodes without compromising accuracy 
       or performance.

2. Advantages Highlighted in Experiments
   -1. Superior Performance:
        -a. Outperforms Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) in solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs).
        -b. Exceeds MLPs in image classification tasks such as MNIST and CIFAR-10.

   -2. Efficiency:
       -a. Faster training and better handling of complex high-dimensional functions compared to KANs and PINNs.

   -3. Comparison with Other Models:
       -a. Demonstrated lower log MSE and faster training times in experiments.

In summary, XNet is a powerful and efficient neural network model that leverages the unique properties of the Cauchy Activation Function 
to simplify design and enhance performance across diverse tasks.
