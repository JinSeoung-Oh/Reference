Prompt Orchestration Markup Language (POML), released by Microsoft, is an HTML/XML-inspired markup language designed for structured, 
modular, and reusable prompt engineering for LLMs. 
It addresses the shortcomings of unstructured text prompts (“prompt spaghetti”) and provides scalability, maintainability, 
and extensibility for advanced AI applications.

1. Core Concepts
   -a. Structured Prompt Definition: Semantic elements like <role>, <task>, <example> organize logical sections of prompts 
                                     → making them more readable and reusable.
   -b. Comprehensive Data Integration: Supports <document>, <table>, <img> and more to embed external text, tables, 
                                       and images directly within prompts.
   -c. Separated Styling Layer: Similar to CSS, <stylesheet> blocks or inline attributes separate output formatting from prompt logic, 
                                enabling A/B testing and reducing fragility.
   -e. Built-in Templating Engine: Includes variables ({{username}}), loops, conditionals, and <let> definitions 
                                   → dynamic and scalable prompt generation.
   -f. Developer Tooling Ecosystem:
       -1. VS Code extension with syntax highlighting, auto-completion, live preview.
       -2. Node.js and Python SDKs for seamless integration with OpenAI, Azure, etc.

2. Example Code (Prompt with Image)
<poml>
  <role>You are a patient teacher explaining concepts to a 10-year-old.</role>
  <task>Explain the concept of photosynthesis using the provided image.</task>
  <img src="photosynthesis_diagram.png" alt="Diagram of photosynthesis"/>
  <output-format>
    Start with "Hey there, future scientist!" and keep the explanation under 100 words.
  </output-format>
</poml>

--> Demonstrates integration of visual context with explicit output constraints.

3. Technical Philosophy
   -a. Mirrors the View Layer in MVC architecture: markup defines presentation only, keeping business logic separate.
   -b. Facilitates prompt refactoring, experimentation, workflow consistency, and automated testing.

4. Installation & Getting Started
   -a. Open-source (MIT License), available on GitHub.
   -b. Installable VS Code extension.
   -c. Node.js (npm install pomljs) and Python (pip install poml) SDKs.

5. Conclusion
   POML establishes itself as a promising standard for LLM prompt engineering, offering:
   -a. Modular syntax,
   -b. Robust data handling,
   -c. Decoupled formatting,
   -d. Dynamic templating,
   -e. Strong integration ecosystem.
  It enables developers to streamline prompt design, debugging, and reuse across complex workflows. 
  Particularly useful for multi-agent orchestration, debugging intricate prompt logic, and deploying reusable AI modules in production.
