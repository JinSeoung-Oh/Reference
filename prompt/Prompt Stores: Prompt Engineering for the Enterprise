1. Introduction
   -a. Core Idea:
       Prompts are now the primary way to interact with large language models (LLMs). They must be tuned for user-specific 
       contexts to maximize the chance of receiving the correct response.
   -b. Emergence of Prompt Engineering:
       The practice of systematically experimenting with prompt variations—recording what works—to find the “best” prompt 
       has given rise to prompt engineering as a professional field. Successful prompts are organized into a “prompt store” for reuse.
   -c. Challenge: 
       Maintaining a high-quality prompt store is difficult because prompts often overlap in content, making it hard to decide 
       which version to store for retrieval later.

2. Problem Statement
   -a. Example in Content Writing:
       Two similar prompts are presented:
       -1. Prompt 1:
           Generates an engaging abstract for a blog post about an eighties-themed cafe, focusing on ambience and menu, 
           and uses a friendly tone targeting an elderly audience.
       -2. Prompt 2:
           Generates an engaging abstract (maximum 200 words) for a newspaper post about a modern-themed cafe, emphasizing
           decor and menu, and uses a friendly tone aimed at a young audience.
  -b. Key Questions:
      When both prompts are approved by human reviewers, which should be added to the prompt store?
      Four options are considered:
      -1. Add both: Might cause retrieval difficulties due to high similarity.
      -2. Add one or the other: Risks losing unique context (e.g., target audience, word count limit).
      -3. Add neither: If a similar prompt already exists.
      -4. Add a template: Create a generalized prompt template with placeholders to capture common elements and list allowed 
          values for each variable. For instance:
          Generate an engaging abstract for a post on the following event. Highlight the theme. Use the specified tone of voice and limit the response to word count.
          Post (type): [newspaper, blog, article, …]
          Event: [opening of cafe, restaurant, diner, …]
          Theme: [ambience, decor, menu, …]
          Tone: [friendly, formal, informative, …]
  -c. Recommendation:
      The last option is suggested because it generalizes the prompt while preserving all important details 
      (such as post type, event, theme, and tone).

3. Prompt Templates in LangChain
   -a. Predefined Classes:
       LangChain offers several classes to help structure prompts:
       -1. PromptTemplate:
           The default template for simple string prompts with variable placeholders.
           '''''
           from langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplate
           prompt_template = PromptTemplate.from_template(
               "Generate an engaging abstract for a {post} on the following {event}."
           )
           prompt_template.format(post="blog", event="opening of cafe")
           '''''
       -2. ChatPromptTemplate:
           Designed for multi-turn conversations where roles (e.g., system, human, ai) are specified. 
           This provides extra context that can improve LLM understanding.
           '''''
           from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
           chat_template = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(
               [
                   ("system", "You are a knoweldgeable AI bot. You are called {name}."),
                   ("human", "Hi, how are you today?"),
                   ("ai", "I'm doing great, thanks! How can I help you?"),
                   ("human", "{user_input}"),
               ]
           )
           messages = chat_template.format_messages(name="Emily", user_input="How should I call you?")
       -3. FewShotPromptTemplate:
           Supports few-shot learning by providing sample question-answer pairs that train the LLM before asking the final question.
           '''''
           from langchain_core.prompts.few_shot import FewShotPromptTemplate
           from langchain_core.prompts.prompt import PromptTemplate
           examples = [
               {"question": "What is the second largest ocean on Earth?", "answer": "Atlantc Ocean"},
               {"question": "What is the tallest mountain in Asia?", "answer": "Mount Everest"},
           ]
           example_prompt = PromptTemplate(
               input_variables=["question", "answer"], template="Question: {question}\n{answer}"
           )
           prompt = FewShotPromptTemplate(
               examples=examples,
               example_prompt=example_prompt,
               suffix="Question: {input}",
               input_variables=["input"],
           )
           print(prompt.format(input="What is the tallest mountain in Africa?"))
           '''''
       -4. Note on Prior Technologies:
           Concepts from earlier chatbots (like intents, utterances, and entities in IBM Watson, AWS Lex, etc.) are similar
           to how LangChain structures prompts. Here, prompt variations act like utterances, 
           and entities are akin to the allowed values for placeholders.

4. Reinforcement Learning Based Prompt Store Curation
   -a. The Curation Challenge:
       When managing an enterprise prompt store with 100+ templates, manually curating them becomes extremely challenging. 
       For each new prompt, you must:
       -1. Extract its template and associated entity values.
       -2. Check for overlaps with existing templates.
       -3. Decide if you add a new template, adapt an existing one, or do nothing.
  -b. Example:
      Suppose an existing template is:
      ''''
      Generate an engaging abstract for a post on the following event. Highlight the theme. Use the specified tone of voice.
      Post (type): [newspaper, blog, article, …]
      Event: [opening of cafe, restaurant, diner, …]
      Theme: [ambience, menu]
      Tone: [informative, formal]
      ''''
      And the new prompt is:
      '''''
      Generate an engaging abstract of no more than 200 words for a newspaper post announcing the opening of a modern-themed cafe. Highlight the decor and menu. Use a friendly tone to appeal to a young customer base.
      '''''      
      In this case, the existing template must be adapted to include a 200-word limit and expand the entity values to:
      -1. Theme: [ambience, decor, menu]
      -2. Tone: [friendly, informative, formal]
  -c. Automation via Reinforcement Learning (RL):
      A proposed solution uses reinforcement learning (RL) with user feedback to semi-automate the curation process:
      -1. A score model is trained to evaluate prompt-response pairs based on user feedback.
      -2. The predicted scores serve as rewards for an RL agent.
      -3. A user simulator feeds prompts (instantiated from templates) into the system.
      -4. The RL agent, implemented using a Deep Q-Network (DQN) with epsilon-greedy exploration, learns a policy for prompt store updates and includes fallback responses for out-of-scope cases.

5. Reinforcement Learning Model Details
   -a. Architecture Overview:
       The RL model comprises:
       -1. NLU Unit:
           An intent recognition component (using LangChain’s PromptTemplate and open-source NLU like Rasa with TensorFlow) 
           that provides initial training.
       -2. User Simulator:
           Randomly selects candidate prompts from a database to be considered for new scenarios.
       -3. Score Model:
           Uses the Universal Sentence Encoder (from TensorFlow Hub) to compute vector representations. 
           It projects prompts and responses into a transformed space where similarity yields high scores. 
           Training is done with a squared error loss (plus L2 regularization) comparing model predictions to human feedback.
       -4. RL Agent:
           Based on a Deep Q-Network (DQN), it learns policies via Q-learning. The network is trained using an experience replay 
           buffer containing state-action-reward tuples.
   -b. Training Process:
       -1. Warm-up Phase:
           The DQN is initially trained on data from the NLU unit, using NLU confidence levels. 
           Data augmentation assigns zero weight to alternative actions when a high-confidence state-action tuple is encountered.
       -2. Epsilon-Greedy Exploration:
           The agent explores with a probability ε, which starts at 0.2 and reduces to 0.05 over time.
       -3. Experience Replay:
           During each epoch, a batch of conversations (10–30 episodes) is simulated. The replay buffer, containing tuples
           (sₜ, aₜ, rₜ), is periodically flushed once performance exceeds a set threshold.
           For state-action pairs earning above 50% reward, other actions for that state are given zero reward to reinforce 
           the correct choice.

6. Conclusion
   -a. Main Challenges:
       The article emphasizes the difficulty of building and maintaining an enterprise prompt store due to overlapping prompt 
       issues. Key questions include whether to add a new prompt directly (complicating retrieval) or to adapt existing ones.
   -b. Organizing Prompts:
       A structured approach using prompt templates (as demonstrated with LangChain’s various classes) is discussed in detail.
   -c. Semi-Automation with RL:
       The article shows how reinforcement learning, leveraging user feedback, can semi-automate prompt store curation. 
       This approach addresses overlapping scopes and guides adaptation when new prompts do not fully align with existing templates.
   -d. Future Needs:
       As prompt stores expand, especially across multiple domains with varying stakeholder views, 
       improved tools and strategies will be essential to resolve prompt scope conflicts effectively.
