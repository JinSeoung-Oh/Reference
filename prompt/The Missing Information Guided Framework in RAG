1. MIGRES (Missing Information Guided Retrieve-Extraction-Solving):
   MIGRES focuses on retrieval-augmented generation by identifying missing information needed to answer a query. 
   It prompts the language model (LLM) to summarize this missing information, formulates targeted queries for retrieval, 
   and extracts relevant information from external sources. The iterative process continues until the LLM can comprehensively answer the query, 
   minimizing the need for complex multi-hop retrieval.

2. Adaptive-RAG (Adaptive Retrieval-Augmented Generation):
   Adaptive-RAG adapts retrieval strategies based on query complexity. It classifies queries into three levels ('A', 'B', 'C') 
   and selects appropriate strategies accordingly. For simple queries, the LLM generates answers directly; 
   for single-hop queries, it integrates retrieved information; for multi-hop queries, it employs iterative retrieval and reasoning. 
   This approach optimizes resource allocation based on query complexity.

3. DRAGIN (Dynamic Retrieval Augmented Generation based on the real-time Information Needs of Large Language Models):
   DRAGIN dynamically triggers retrieval based on real-time information needs during generation. 
   It includes two components: Real-time Information Needs Detection (RIND) and Query Formulation based on Self-attention (QFS). 
   RIND analyzes uncertainty, importance, and semantic significance to trigger retrieval, while QFS formulates effective queries 
   using self-attention mechanism. This ensures timely retrieval of relevant information to support generation.

These methodologies, when integrated, offer a comprehensive solution for optimizing retrieval in knowledge-intensive generation tasks,
balancing efficiency, accuracy, and adaptability.
