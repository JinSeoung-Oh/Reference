1. Context: From Models to Agents
   As AI systems evolve from standalone models into Agentic AI ecosystems, 
   we need something similar to what API management provided for microservices 
   — a foundation that supports development, discovery, and composition of autonomous agents.

   The core pillars of this foundation are:
   -a. Agent Development & Publishing
   -b. Agent Discovery
   -c. Agent Composition (stitching agents together to complete complex tasks)

2. Agent Development & Publishing
   -a. Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)
       ADK is an open-source framework that helps developers build intelligent agents. 
       It offers structured components:
       -1. Agents: Core execution units
       -2. Tools: External capabilities agents can use
       -3. Memory/State: Mechanisms for remembering across steps
       -4. Runners: Manage agent lifecycles
       -5. Callbacks: Allow logging and monitoring
       -6. UI/CLI + Evaluation Tools: Help in building and debugging
       -7. Multimodal support: Includes audio/video streaming for interactive agents (like Project Astra)
   -b. Google Agent2Agent Protocol (A2A)
       ADK builds agents. A2A lets them communicate.
       -1. It's an open, vendor-neutral protocol.
       -2. Agents can publish themselves by exposing an Agent Card (a machine-readable profile).
       -3. A2A standardizes how agents discover each other, exchange data, and collaborate 
           — even across different platforms or frameworks (ADK, LangGraph, CrewAI, etc).

3. Agent Discovery
   -a. Google Agentspace + Agent Gallery
       After agents are published via A2A, users (or other agents) need a way to find them.
       -1. Agentspace: A unified enterprise platform that connects AI agents with enterprise data 
                       (SharePoint, Salesforce, etc.).
       -2. Agent Gallery: A catalog within Agentspace that shows all discoverable agents.
   -b. This enables:
       -1. Browsing/searching agents based on capabilities
       -2. One-click activation or integration
       -3. Enterprise-level access control and search relevance
   Agentspace bridges technical capabilities (ADK + A2A) and real users in the enterprise.

4. Agent Execution at Runtime
   -a. Google Vertex AI Agent Engine
       To make agents useful, they must run in production.
       -1. Agent Engine is a managed runtime inside Google Vertex AI.
       -2. It handles:
           -1) Infrastructure (containers, networking)
           -2) Scaling
           -3) Security
           -4) Deployment lifecycle
       Agents running here can appear in the Agent Gallery, ready for users or orchestrating agents to use.
       Developers focus on logic; Agent Engine takes care of everything else.

5. Agent Composition: Stitching Multiple Agents Together
   Complex tasks often require multiple agents to work together.
   -a. How the Full Stack Supports This:
       Stage	| Technology	| Purpose
       Create Agents	| ADK	| Define logic, tools, workflows (e.g., Sequential, Parallel, Loop)
       Let Them Talk | 	A2A	| Standardized messaging, task negotiation, data exchange
       Find Each Other	| Agentspace + Agent Gallery	| Discovery via searchable, structured Agent Cards
       Connect to Tools	| ADK + MCP	| External tool use via Model Context Protocol (e.g., databases, APIs)
       Run in Production	| Agent Engine	| Managed, scalable execution of single or multi-agent systems
   -b. Agent composition could be:
       -1. Intra-agent (within a single ADK app, using multi-agent structures)
       -2. Inter-agent (across frameworks or organizations, via A2A protocol)
   -c. Real-World Example:
       -a. A support bot (ADK) finds a customer’s profile (via another agent using Salesforce)
       -b. Queries shipping status (via API tool using MCP)
       -c. Hands off to a specialized returns agent
       -d. All agents communicate over A2A, discovered via Agent Gallery, and execute on Agent Engine

6. Summary: How It All Fits
   The full Agentic AI stack from Google includes:
   Component	| Role
   ADK	| Build individual agents with tools, memory, structure
   A2A	| Let agents from anywhere talk to each other
   Agentspace	| Connect users and agents to enterprise data
   Agent Gallery	| Discover and catalog agents
   MCP	| Connect agents to APIs and data sources
   Agent Engine	| Deploy and run everything at scale
   Just like microservices needed APIs + discovery + runtime, Agentic AI needs ADK + A2A + Agent Engine to scale.
