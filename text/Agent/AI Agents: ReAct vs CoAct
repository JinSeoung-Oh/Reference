1. Introduction
   Recent advances in AI have pushed models to interleave reasoning and acting, 
   enabling them to solve tasks that require both knowledge and interaction with their environment. 
   Two prominent frameworks in this evolution are ReAct and CoAct. While ReAct demonstrated that a single agent could alternate 
   between internal reasoning (a chain-of-thought) and external action, 
   CoAct takes it further by splitting these roles between specialized agents—a global planner and a local executor—to handle complex,
   multi-step tasks more effectively.

2. Overview of ReAct
   ReAct (Reason + Act) is a framework where a single AI agent operates in a loop that alternates between thinking and doing.
   -a. Process Flow:
       -1. The agent starts with a Thought step: it reasons internally (e.g., “I need to search for information on X”).
       -2. It then performs an Action (e.g., “Search for X”), which yields an Observation.
       -3. This observation is fed back into the agent’s internal context, guiding the next Thought.
       -4. The cycle repeats until the task is completed, with the chain-of-thought maintained as a dynamic working memory.
   -b. Advantages:
       -1. Simplicity & Transparency: The entire reasoning and acting process is encapsulated within one model, 
                                      making it straightforward to implement and debug.
       -2. Unified Feedback Loop: It updates its internal state continuously through the feedback received from its actions.
   -c. Limitations:
       -1. Context Window Constraints: As tasks become longer, the single agent’s context can become overloaded, 
                                       leading to loss of earlier reasoning steps.
       -2. Error Propagation: Without an external mechanism to re-assess, early mistakes in the reasoning process can cascade 
                              through the entire task.

3. Overview of CoAct
   CoAct (Collaborative or Coordinated Act) expands upon ReAct by introducing a hierarchical structure with two distinct agents:
   -a. Global Planning Agent:
       -1. Responsible for high-level strategic reasoning.
       -2. It receives the overall task, breaks it into discrete subtasks (e.g., “For a trip: find flights, book hotels, 
           schedule activities”), and constructs a global roadmap.
       -3. It does not interact directly with the environment but focuses on planning and monitoring the entire process.
   -b. Local Execution Agent:
       -1. Handles the detailed, low-level execution of the subtasks.
       -2. Upon receiving a subtask (e.g., “Find and purchase a book online”), the local agent performs the necessary actions 
           (searching, clicking, checking out) and then reports the results or any encountered errors back to the global planner.
   -c. Feedback Loop:
       -1. The local agent continuously provides feedback about its success or failure.
       -2. The global agent uses this feedback to re-plan if necessary—adjusting strategies or reassigning subtasks if problems occur.
   -d. Advantages:
       -1. Scalability: The separation of planning and execution means the system can manage long-horizon tasks without 
                        overloading a single model’s context.
       -2. Robust Error Handling: If the local agent encounters an obstacle (e.g., a product is out of stock), 
                                  the global agent can re-plan and delegate a revised subtask.
       -3. Specialization: By assigning different responsibilities to different agents, CoAct can potentially extend to multi-agent
                           systems where even more specialized roles exist.
   -e. Limitations:
       -1. Increased Complexity: Coordinating multiple agents requires establishing protocols for inter-agent communication 
                                 and handling potential misalignments.
       -2. Resource Overhead: Running multiple agents concurrently may require additional computational resources.
       -3. Coordination Challenges: Effective division of tasks is essential; if the global and local agents miscommunicate, 
                                    important details might be lost between phases.

4. Formulation and Theoretical Perspective
   This section formalizes the difference between ReAct and CoAct from a theoretical viewpoint:
   -a. ReAct as a Single Policy:
       -1. Unified Decision-Making:
           A ReAct agent is governed by a single policy π that maps the current state—comprising the entire history of thoughts, 
           actions, and observations—to the next action.
       -2. Integrated Reasoning and Acting:
           The output from the model includes both internal “thoughts” (which serve as the chain-of-thought) and external actions 
           (such as querying an API). 
           Formally, at each time step t, the agent updates a trajectory:
           (𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑒_𝑡,𝑡ℎ𝑜𝑢𝑔ℎ𝑡_𝑡,𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛_𝑡,𝑜𝑏𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛_𝑡)
           This formulation is monolithic; the same decision process determines whether the next output should be another thought 
           or an action, without explicit separation between planning and execution.
   -b. CoAct as a Hierarchical Policy:
       -1. Decomposition into Two Levels:
           CoAct divides the overall task between two policies:
           -1) Global Policy (π_g): Operates on the high-level state to produce a plan or decide the next subtask  
                                    𝑠𝑢𝑏𝑡𝑎𝑠𝑘_𝑖=𝜋_𝑔(𝑠)
           -2) Local Policy (π_l): Receives the subtask and the current local state to output a series of low-level actions 
                                   𝑎_𝑖1,𝑎_𝑖2,…,𝑎_𝑖𝑛 until that subtask is completed.
           -3) Feedback and Re-Planning:
               After the local agent completes or fails a subtask, the outcome 𝑠′ is fed back to the global agent. 
               This enables the global policy to adjust subsequent subtasks or re-plan if needed.
           -4) Hierarchical Control:
               The overall decision process in CoAct is thus split into an outer loop (global planning) and an inner loop 
               (local execution), effectively implementing a hierarchical reinforcement learning structure. 
               This separation helps manage long sequences and complex tasks by ensuring that high-level strategies are maintained 
               without being overwhelmed by low-level details.

5. Comparative Analysis: ReAct vs. CoAct
   -a. Reasoning vs. Action Mechanisms
       -1. ReAct:
           -1) Combines reasoning and action in a single stream.
           -2) The agent continuously alternates between generating internal thoughts and executing external actions.
           -3) Lacks explicit separation between planning and execution.
       -2. CoAct:
           -1) Separates the cognitive process into two distinct roles: a global planner that outlines the overall strategy 
               and a local executor that handles detailed steps.
           -2) This two-tier system enables dynamic re-planning and more robust error handling for complex, multi-step tasks.
   -b. Error Handling and Adaptability
       -1. ReAct:
           -1) If an error occurs early in the chain-of-thought, it might propagate through the entire process with limited 
               corrective mechanisms.
           -2) The single agent must self-correct, which can be challenging if it gets stuck or misinterprets feedback.
      -2. CoAct:
          -1) Incorporates a feedback loop where the local agent reports failures to the global agent.
          -2) The global planner can then re-assess and re-plan, reducing the risk of getting stuck in repetitive loops.
          -3) This hierarchical structure allows for targeted adjustments, leading to improved performance on long-horizon tasks.
  -c. Context Management and Scalability
      -1. ReAct:
          -1) Uses a single context window to store the entire chain-of-thought and all observations, which can be limiting \
              for long or complex tasks.
      -2. CoAct:
          -1) The global agent maintains a high-level summary of progress, while the local agent focuses on the current subtask.
          -2) This modular context management helps prevent the overflow of information and enables more effective scaling for
              tasks that require extensive planning and execution.
  -d. Adaptability and Parallelism
      -1. ReAct:
          -1) Although versatile for many tasks, its monolithic nature restricts its ability to handle tasks that benefit from 
              parallel processing or distributed reasoning.
      -2. CoAct:
          -1) Opens possibilities for multi-agent extensions where multiple local executors can work in parallel under 
              a single global planner.
          -2) This division allows for more adaptable workflows, especially when tasks can be segmented into independent 
              or loosely coupled subtasks.

6. Performance Benchmarks and Practical Use Cases
   -a. Empirical Results:
       -1. ReAct has demonstrated improved accuracy on benchmarks like HotpotQA and FEVER, particularly for tasks involving tool 
           use and dynamic reasoning.
       -2. CoAct, though tested primarily in web navigation tasks (e.g., WebArena), has shown a significant boost in success 
           rates—rising from an average of around 9.4% for ReAct agents to 13.8–16% for CoAct agents on complex, long-horizon tasks.
           This improvement is attributed to its hierarchical planning, which allows for re-planning and error correction.
   -b. Real-World Applications:
       -1. ReAct: Ideal for tasks such as information retrieval, tool-based question answering, or interactive text-based games 
                  where a single, continuous reasoning loop is sufficient.
       -2. CoAct: Best suited for complex, multi-step workflows such as online shopping, project planning, 
                  troubleshooting technical issues, or scenarios that require dynamic task reorganization and error recovery.

7. Conclusion
   ReAct and CoAct mark important evolutionary steps in AI agent design by combining internal reasoning with external action.
   ReAct demonstrates that a single agent can alternate between thinking and doing in a fluid loop, providing clear,
   interpretable reasoning traces. 
   However, its monolithic structure may struggle with tasks that exceed the model’s context or require substantial re-planning.
   CoAct addresses these challenges by splitting the process into two specialized roles—a global planning agent for high-level 
   strategy and a local execution agent for detailed actions.
   This hierarchical model enables more robust error handling, scalability, and adaptability for complex tasks. 
   The theoretical formulation highlights that while ReAct operates as a single, unified policy, CoAct implements
   a hierarchical policy where the global and local agents work in tandem to optimize task performance.

   In summary, the choice between ReAct and CoAct depends on task complexity:
   -a. ReAct is well-suited for shorter, self-contained tasks where the reasoning chain remains within the context window.
   -b. CoAct excels in complex, long-horizon tasks by decomposing them into manageable subtasks and providing a mechanism
       for dynamic re-planning and error recovery.

   As AI applications continue to grow in complexity, frameworks like CoAct that mirror human organizational strategies—dividing 
   high-level planning and detailed execution—are likely to become increasingly essential. 
   This hierarchical approach not only improves overall task success but also provides a roadmap for building even more scalable 
   and robust multi-agent systems in the future.
