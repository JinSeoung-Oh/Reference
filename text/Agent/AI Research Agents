1. Stanford STORM - https://storm.genie.stanford.edu/ & https://github.com/stanford-oval/storm
   Leveraging large language models (LLMs), STORM automates the research and writing process by conducting internet-based research, 
   organizing information into structured outlines, and producing full-length articles complete with citations.

   -1. Pros:
       -a. Automated Research and Writing
           STORM streamlines the creation of detailed articles by automating both the research and writing stages, 
           saving users significant time and effort.
       -b. Structured Content Generation
           The system generates organized outlines and well-structured articles, ensuring clarity and coherence in the final output.
       -c. Open-Source Accessibility
           As an open-source project, STORM allows users to customize and adapt the tool to their specific needs,
           fostering innovation and collaboration within the AI research community.

   -2. Cons:
       -a. Dependence on Internet Sources
           STORM’s reliance on internet-based research may lead to the inclusion of outdated or biased information 
           if not carefully monitored.
       -b. Quality Control Requirements
           While STORM automates much of the writing process, the generated articles may still require human review 
           and editing to ensure accuracy and adherence to specific standards.
       -c. Technical Setup
           Implementing STORM locally necessitates familiarity with tools like Git, Python, and Conda, which may present a barrier
           for users without a technical background.

2. CustomGPT.ai Researcher - https://researcher.customgpt.ai/
