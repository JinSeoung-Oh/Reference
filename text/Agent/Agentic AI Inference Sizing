1. Introduction
   -a. Agentic AI Evolution:
       The article begins by contrasting basic generative models (like ChatGPT, which primarily respond to text-based queries)
       with agentic AI systems. Unlike traditional chatbots, agentic AI agents are designed to autonomously execute complex,
       multi-step tasks (e.g., booking travel, ordering services, or coordinating a sales campaign) 
       by decomposing tasks into subtasks and executing them in a coordinated manner.
   -b. Bill Gates’ Vision:
       Bill Gates’ vision of an AI agent that handles multifaceted tasks—such as planning an entire trip based on 
       your preferences—is highlighted as a real-world example of agentic AI’s potential.
   -c. Focus on Pricing & Sizing:
       The core of the article addresses how to estimate the cost (and resource requirements) for these sophisticated 
       agentic AI systems. 
       It discusses how to map traditional LLM inference dimensions to a system that orchestrates multiple agents, 
       considering factors like latency, throughput, context windows, and non-deterministic task execution.

2. Generative & Agentic AI Architectural Patterns
   The article categorizes AI systems into several architectural patterns, emphasizing that agentic AI is emerging
   as the next step beyond standalone LLMs:

   2.1 Black-box LLM APIs:
       -a. Definition:
           These are standard interfaces (e.g., ChatGPT) where users interact with a closed, managed LLM.
       -b. Prompt Engineering:
           Prompts are critical for eliciting the best responses. Extensive research in prompt engineering has led 
           to enterprise prompt stores that consolidate best practices.
   2.2 Embedded LLM Apps:
       -a. Integration in Enterprise Platforms:
           LLMs are embedded within SaaS products (like Salesforce or ServiceNow) or delivered as standalone enterprise 
           applications.
       -b. Data Ownership & IP Concerns:
           Enterprises must address data usage rights, training data ownership, and liability issues when integrating 
           third-party LLM models.
   2.3 LLM Fine-tuning / Domain-specific SLMs:
       -a. Contextualization:
           Generic LLMs are fine-tuned with domain-specific enterprise data (documents, wikis, business processes) to create 
           smaller, specialized language models.
       -b. Cost-effective Approaches:
           Open-source models (e.g., the LLaMA family) enable fine-tuning on enterprise data at a fraction of the cost compared
           to closed models.
   2.4 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):
       -a. Concept:
           RAG systems combine retrieval mechanisms with generative models. A set of documents or context is retrieved 
           (using vector search or similar techniques) and provided as part of the prompt to guide the model's output.
       -b. Architecture:
           The RAG pipeline typically involves three phases: Retrieve (query embedding and similarity search), 
           Augment (combining retrieved documents with the prompt), and Generate (producing a contextualized response).
   2.5 Agentic AI — LLM Orchestration:
       -a. Future of AI Agents:
           Agentic AI systems orchestrate multiple LLM agents to tackle complex tasks. 
           They are composed of several integrated components:
           -1. Agent Marketplace: Where different specialized agents are available.
           -2. Orchestration Layer: Handles task decomposition and agent coordination.
           -3. Integration Layer: Connects agents to external systems (e.g., CRM systems) via APIs or protocols 
                                  (like Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol).
           -4. Shared Memory & Governance Layers: Maintain execution context over long-running tasks and enforce data privacy, 
                                                  explainability, and security.
   Long-Running Execution:
   For tasks such as an email campaign that spans days or weeks, maintaining context and state is crucial. 
   This is typically handled by saving embeddings in vector stores and using approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) 
   search for efficient retrieval.

3. LLM Inference Sizing Dimensions
   Before extending to agentic AI, the article first outlines the key dimensions that affect LLM inference sizing for 
   typical use cases:

   -a. Context Window:
       Models process inputs and outputs within a fixed token window (commonly 4K–8K tokens, translating to roughly 
       3,000–6,000 words in English). This limits the amount of information that can be processed in one pass.
   -b. Model Size & Precision:
       Inference speed and memory consumption depend on model parameters, and whether models run in full precision or 
       are quantized.
   -c. Latency:
       -1. First-token latency: Time until the first token is generated (important in streaming scenarios).
       -2. Inter-token and last-token latency: Overall generation time for completing the response.
   -d. Throughput:
       Defined as the number of requests processed per unit time, particularly relevant in batch or offline processing scenarios.
   -e. Batching and Parallelism:
       For high throughput, determining if the model fits on one GPU or requires parallelism (pipeline or tensor parallelism)
       is essential, along with adjusting batch size accordingly.

4. Agentic AI Inference Sizing Considerations
   Extending from single LLM inference to a system orchestrating multiple agents introduces additional factors:
   4.1 Agent Observability:
       -a. Mapping Token Latency:
           The concept of token latency translates to individual agent execution latency. This includes both the time taken 
           by the first agent (first-token equivalent) and the total time for the entire orchestration (end-to-end latency).
       -b. Streaming vs. Batch Execution:
           In some scenarios, you may want to stream outputs as each agent finishes, while in others, waiting for 
           full orchestration completion might be acceptable.
   4.2 Agentic Context Window Size:
       -a. Chaining Contexts:
           The output from one agent is fed as input to the next. This, along with the overall execution state 
           (maintained in a shared memory layer), effectively increases the input context size for downstream agents.
       -b. Implication:
           Careful sizing of context windows is needed to ensure that all relevant information is preserved without 
           overwhelming the model.
   4.3 Non-determinism in Agentic AI Execution:
       -a. Uncertainty and Choice:
           Agentic workflows may include non-deterministic elements. For example, in an e-shopping scenario, 
           choices like “Check Credit” or “Delivery Mode” might lead to different execution paths.
       -b. Handling Variability:
           Strategies such as flattening the execution plan to estimate best- and worst-case scenarios help manage this 
           uncertainty. This ensures that even when certain tasks are skipped or executed differently, the system remains robust.

5. LLM Inference Sizing and Pricing: Trade-offs
   -a. Batch vs. Streaming:
       -1. Increasing batch size can improve throughput (more requests processed simultaneously) but may worsen latency.
       -2. Streaming mode prioritizes reducing first-token latency, which is critical for interactive applications.
   -b. Hardware Upgrades:
       Faster GPUs or more optimized parallel processing (e.g., using pipeline parallelism) can improve both latency and 
       throughput, impacting overall pricing and system sizing.
   -c. Cost Considerations:
       Pricing agentic AI systems must account for the extended inference required by orchestrated workflows. 
       This includes evaluating token generation costs, extended execution times for multi-agent plans, 
       and memory/storage requirements for maintaining long-term context.

6. Conclusion
   The article presents a comprehensive framework for understanding and sizing agentic AI systems:
   -a. From Single LLM Inference:
       Starting with conventional dimensions like context window, model size, latency, and throughput.
   -b. To Multi-Agent Orchestration:
       Expanding these dimensions to cover agent-specific factors such as chaining context, non-deterministic execution,
       and long-term observability.
   -c. Architectural Patterns:
       Several patterns—ranging from black-box APIs to embedded LLM apps and RAG pipelines—play a role in forming a full 
       agentic AI system.
   -d. Integration Layers:
       Key to connecting disparate agents and enterprise systems, ensuring that data flows seamlessly while managing privacy, 
       security, and governance.

   By meticulously evaluating these dimensions, organizations can better estimate the resource requirements, 
   cost implications, and performance trade-offs when deploying agentic AI systems. 
   This detailed understanding is critical for scaling these complex systems in real-world enterprise environments.
