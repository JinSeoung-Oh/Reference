## I think Agentic Mesh is not common term. But It is good reference

The Agentic Mesh is a next-generation framework designed to support a vast, interconnected ecosystem of autonomous agents. 
These agents, powered by Agentic AI, can work independently, 
using sophisticated reasoning and planning to accomplish complex tasks without human intervention. 
With Agentic Mesh, agents are able to discover, interact, collaborate, and transact with each other in a secure, structured,
and scalable environment.

1. Agentic AI and Autonomous Agents
   Agentic AI refers to AI systems capable of autonomous decision-making. Using advanced reasoning and iterative planning, 
   these agents pursue specific goals, handling multi-step tasks on behalf of users and other agents. 
   This independence enables them to adapt and respond to dynamic environments, much like human workers.
   
   Autonomous agents built on this technology can manage and execute a range of complex tasks, such as customer support, 
   accounting, and project management, by integrating AI-driven decision-making with specialized capabilities.

2. The Role of Agentic Mesh
   Agentic Mesh functions as an ecosystem infrastructure that connects these autonomous agents, enabling them to work together cohesively. 
   It supports safe discovery, communication, and coordination among agents, ensuring efficient task execution 
   and secure transactions within a regulated network. This environment addresses key questions in agent ecosystems, such as:

   -1. How do agents find and verify each other?
   -2. How do they interact and transact securely?
   -3. How is trust established in their interactions?

3. Core Components of Agentic Mesh

   - 1. Marketplace
       The Marketplace is the main interface where users interact with agents. It functions like an app store for autonomous agents, providing:

     -a. Discovery Tools: Users search for agents that align with their needs, using filters to sort by capabilities, industry, or policies.
     -b. Performance Tracking: Users can monitor agent tasks and track outcomes.
     -c. Feedback Mechanisms: Feedback from users helps ensure agent accountability and reliability.
     -d. Human Oversight: For tasks requiring regulatory compliance or safety verification, users can monitor and guide agent actions.

   -2. Registry
       The Registry is a centralized repository containing essential metadata for each agent. It enables structured agent management by maintaining:

       -a. Capabilities: Defines what each agent can do.
       -b. Ownership Information: Tracks the individual or organization responsible for each agent, fostering accountability.
       -c. Policies and Security Roles: Lists operational guidelines and safety standards.
       -d. Lifecycle Information: Tracks the agent’s status, updates, and operational history.

       The Registry also serves as a trust-building mechanism, as it includes certifications and third-party audit results, 
       allowing users to verify an agent’s compliance with standards.

   -3. DNS System
       The Domain Name System (DNS) within Agentic Mesh translates human-readable agent names (e.g., “agent.company.com”) to IP addresses. 
       This makes agents globally accessible by enabling secure location and interaction across the internet, much like conventional websites.

4. Characteristics of Autonomous Agents in Agentic Mesh
   Agents in the Agentic Mesh ecosystem are governed by six core characteristics that ensure reliability and safety:
 
   -a. Purposefulness: Agents operate within well-defined roles and objectives, ensuring that each action aligns with a specific purpose. 
                       Purpose sets the boundaries for what an agent can and should do, preventing it from engaging in unrelated 
                       or inappropriate tasks.
   -b. Accountability: Ownership of each agent is clearly defined, holding an individual or organization responsible for 
                       its behavior and performance. Ownership ensures proper governance, allowing authority and control to be established, 
                       delegated, and enforced as needed.
   -c. Trustworthiness: Trustworthiness is built on an agent’s consistency, predictability, and compliance with its purpose and policies. 
                        It includes third-party certifications, audit trails, and adherence to ethical and legal standards, 
                        enhancing confidence in agent reliability.
   -d. Autonomy: Agents act independently within their defined purpose and constraints, making decisions without constant supervision. 
                 This autonomy is crucial for scalability, as it allows agents to operate and adapt in real-time 
                 while still adhering to their boundaries.
   -e. Discoverability: Registered agents can be easily found by users or other agents, facilitated by metadata in the Registry. 
                        Discoverability enables efficient collaboration and selection of agents that meet specific requirements.
   -d Intelligence: Agents leverage large language models (LLMs) and other AI systems to generate execution plans, reason through complex tasks, 
                    and interact in natural language. Some agents may also use specialized LLMs tailored to their industry or field, 
                    allowing them to perform expert-level tasks.

5. Agent Lifecycle Stages in the Agentic Mesh
   -1. Registration
       Registration is the initial stage where agents set up their identity and capabilities:

       -a. Configuration: Agents define purpose, ownership, capabilities, and security requirements.
       -b. Registry Submission: Metadata is submitted to the Registry, making the agent part of the Mesh ecosystem.
       -c. DNS Registration: DNS associates the agent’s chosen name with its IP address, making it accessible globally.
       -d. Approval: Human oversight or third-party validation may approve the agent’s registration to verify safety and compliance.

   -2. Discovery
       Discovery is how agents and users locate registered agents:

       -a. Search and Query: Agents and users query the Registry for agents that match specific criteria.
       -b. DNS Lookup: Once identified, the agent’s DNS name is resolved to facilitate direct connections.
       -c. Direct Interaction: Agents initiate connections based on the discovery results to collaborate on tasks.

   -3. Execution
       Execution is the full process where an agent is selected, plans tasks, and completes them:

       -a. Agent Selection: Users find agents through the Marketplace and select based on their needs.
       -b. Execution Planning: Agents create an execution plan with the help of LLMs.
       -c. Task Collaboration: Agents may collaborate with others, initiating sub-tasks as needed.
       -d. Result Management: The agent reports progress and outcomes back to the user or controlling agent, ensuring transparency.
