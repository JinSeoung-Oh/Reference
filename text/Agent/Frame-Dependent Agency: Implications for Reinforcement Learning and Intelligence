The study delves into the concept of agency—defined as a system’s ability to direct outcomes toward a goal—and argues 
that this ability cannot be judged in an absolute sense. 
Instead, whether a system exhibits agency depends critically on the reference frame chosen for evaluation. 
Below is a detailed breakdown of the key points:

1. Definition and Fundamental Claim
   -a. Agency Defined: Agency is characterized as the capacity of a system to steer or direct outcomes in pursuit of a goal.
   -b. Frame Dependence: The core argument is that determining if a system is agentic is not an inherent property 
                         of the system but rather relies on the perspective or reference frame from which it is analyzed. 
                         This means that the same system might be considered to have agency under one set of evaluative criteria, 
                         but not under another.

2. Research Context and Background
   -a. Collaborative Effort: Researchers from Google DeepMind and the University of Alberta are involved, highlighting the study’s
                             relevance to artificial intelligence and reinforcement learning.
   -b. Reinforcement Learning (RL) Lens: The investigation is particularly focused on RL, where agents are designed to
                                         make decisions to achieve specific goals. 
                                         Understanding agency from a frame-dependent perspective is crucial because it influences 
                                         how we design and evaluate these agents.

3. Essential Properties of Agency
   The study builds on prior work by dissecting four core properties of agency, each of which is shown to be contingent on 
   the chosen reference frame:

   -a. Individuality:
       -1. Concept: This property concerns defining the boundaries of a system—what counts as the agent versus its environment.
       -2. Frame Dependence: The decision of where to draw this boundary is inherently subjective and varies with the reference frame.
   -b. Source of Action:
       -1. Concept: This addresses the origin of the system’s actions—whether they stem from internal mechanisms or 
                    external influences.
       -2. Frame Dependence: Evaluating whether actions are self-initiated requires a specific contextual frame, 
                             as different frames might attribute the action to different causes.
   -c. Normativity:
       -1. Concept: Normativity involves determining if the system's actions are directed toward achieving a goal in 
                    a “meaningful” way, often measured against a set of norms or criteria.
       -2. Frame Dependence: What is considered goal-directed behavior can vary greatly depending on the interpretative 
                             framework used.
   -d. Adaptivity:
       -1. Concept: Adaptivity refers to the system’s ability to change its behavior in response to environmental feedback.
       -2. Frame Dependence: Assessing adaptivity also relies on the context and the criteria established by the chosen 
                             reference frame.

4. Implications for Reinforcement Learning (RL)
   -a. Design and Evaluation: In RL, agents are constructed to perform tasks and achieve goals. 
                              Recognizing that agency is frame-dependent suggests that the design, performance, and evaluation 
                              of these agents could differ dramatically based on how their reference frames are defined.
   -b. Need for a Foundational Science: For RL and other fields that rely on understanding intelligent behavior,
                                        there is a call to develop a foundational science of agency. 
      -1. Establishing precise definitions for what constitutes a valid reference frame.
      -2. Formalizing the criteria or principles that guide the selection of these frames.
      -3. Investigating and comparing different frame-selection principles to see how they affect the interpretation
          of agent behavior.

5. Broader Context and Everyday Examples
   -a. Interdisciplinary Relevance: The concept of agency is not limited to AI. It spans biology, philosophy, and cognitive science,
                                    where similar questions about goal-directed behavior and decision-making arise.
   -b. Illustrative Examples:
       -1. A thermostat is often cited as a system that appears to act with agency because it maintains a set temperature. 
           However, whether it is truly agentic depends on how we define its boundaries and goals.
       -2. Similarly, a rock rolling down a hill might be interpreted as pursuing the goal of reaching the bottom, 
           but this is clearly a matter of perspective—attributing goal-directedness to an inanimate object depends entirely 
           on the reference frame used.

6. Agency and Intelligence: Unresolved Interconnections
   -a. Close but Unclear Relationship: While agency is closely linked to intelligence, the precise nature of their 
                                       relationship remains an open question.
   -b. New Research Frontier: Exploring this relationship through the lens of frame dependence could provide fresh insights.
       -1. Future work should aim to develop a formal proof or rigorous definition supporting the frame-dependent nature of agency. 
       -2. Researchers need to determine defensible principles for selecting reference frames and explore the implications 
           these choices have on our understanding of both agency and intelligence.

7. Future Directions and Research Challenges
   -a. Formal Definitions and Proofs: A key next step is to establish formal definitions of agent reference frames 
                                      and to provide rigorous proofs for the frame-dependent nature of agency.
   -b. Comparative Analysis: It is important to investigate and compare different principles for reference frame selection. 
                             This comparison will help in understanding how varying definitions impact the assessment 
                             of agency across different systems.
   -c. Broader Implications: Understanding frame dependence in agency could reshape foundational theories in reinforcement
                             learning and other fields that study intelligent behavior, leading to more robust models and evaluation criteria.

In summary:
The study argues that agency—the capacity of a system to direct outcomes toward a goal—is not an absolute, intrinsic property. 
Instead, it is highly dependent on the evaluative reference frame. 
This frame-dependent view influences how we understand the four essential properties of agency
(individuality, source of action, normativity, and adaptivity) and has profound implications for fields like reinforcement learning.
Moving forward, the challenge lies in developing precise, formalized criteria for selecting reference frames 
and understanding how these choices affect our broader understanding of agency and intelligence.
