1. Overview of Reasoning in LLMs:
   Reasoning is the next big challenge in generative AI, involving the decomposition of tasks into smaller,
   manageable subsets. Techniques like Chain-of-Thought, Tree-of-Thought, Skeleton-of-Thought, 
   and Reflexion have emerged, but they often fail to generalize across domains due to high computational demands.
   A recent paper from Meta AI, Allen Institute of AI, and the University of Washington addresses these challenges.

2. Introducing HUSKY
   HUSKY is an open-source language agent designed for complex tasks involving numerical, tabular, and knowledge-based reasoning.
   Unlike task-specific models, HUSKY operates within a unified framework to handle diverse challenges through
   a two-stage process: generating and executing actions with expert models.

3. HUSKY's Approach
  -1. Action Generation: Determines the next step and required tool.
  -2. Action Execution: Uses specialized models to perform the action and update the solution.

4. Detailed Mechanism:
   -1. Action Plan: Generates the next step, selects the tool, executes with expert models, and updates the solution state.
   -2. Tool Integration: Uses predefined tools (code, math, search, commonsense) and calls expert models based on the tool assigned.
   -3. Training: Involves creating tool-integrated solution trajectories with a teacher model to build training data for both the action generator and expert models.
   -4. Inference: Uses trained modules iteratively to solve multi-step tasks.

5. Evaluation and Performance
   HUSKY is evaluated on various reasoning tasks, including
   -1. Numerical Reasoning: Utilizes datasets like GSM-8K, MATH, and MathQA, with tasks ranging from elementary to high school level.
   -2. Tabular Reasoning: Involves datasets like TabMWP, FinQA, and TAT-QA.
   -3. Knowledge-based Reasoning: Uses datasets like HotpotQA, CWQ, and Musique.

6. Key Findings
   HUSKY matches or surpasses frontier models like GPT-4, even with smaller models.
   Evaluations highlight HUSKY's ability to perform complex reasoning tasks effectively using 
   a combination of action generation and expert models.

7. Conclusion
   HUSKY demonstrates a significant advancement in language agents, offering a versatile solution for complex reasoning tasks.
   Its holistic approach enables it to tackle diverse challenges, making it a promising tool for the future of AI.
