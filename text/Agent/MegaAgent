The MegaAgent framework is designed to handle complex tasks by dividing them into smaller, manageable components across multiple levels of agents.
It ensures efficient task distribution, execution, and management. 

Below is a summary of its five key components:

1. Multi-Level Task Splitting
   - Task Division
     The MegaAgent accepts a prompt and splits it into smaller subtasks, assigning these to different agent groups.
   - Hierarchy
     Each subtask is managed by an admin agent, who oversees progress. Admin agents can work independently or recruit other agents to further decompose tasks.
   - Iterative Process
     This hierarchical design allows tasks to be broken down iteratively, with new levels created as needed. 
     This structure ensures the system can handle increasing complexity without overloading any single agent.

2. Action Module
   - Execution
     The action module comprises various agent groups, each responsible for specific subtasks. Admin agents break down these tasks further,
     and agents within the group coordinate and update their progress.
   - Data Retrieval
     A data retriever interfaces between the action and storage modules, managing function calls like file operations and checklists.
     It ensures tasks are automated and that the system can scale efficiently.
   - Parallelism
     The action module supports parallel execution, reducing task completion time compared to linear methods.

3. Storage Module
   - Components
     The storage module includes a database, files, and checklists, and incorporates Git for version control.
   - File Management
     When agents interact with files, they also manage Git commits, ensuring changes are properly merged and tracked. Merge conflicts are resolved by the agents as needed.
   - Memory Management
     A memory database stores long-term summaries, allowing agents to recall previous conversations and progress. 
     The vector database uses embeddings to retrieve similar messages, helping agents dynamically update their tasks.
   - Task Monitoring
     The task monitor checks for the existence of output files, verifies content, and assigns rework if necessary.

4. Monitor Mechanism
   - Oversight
     The OS agent ensures that output meets expected standards. If discrepancies are found, the agent records an error and prompts a retry.
   - Checklist Verification
     Each agent maintains a checklist to track actions. Admin agents review these checklists to confirm task completion,
     with retries managed by the OS agent if results are unsatisfactory.

5. Communication Mechanism
   - Communication Structure
     Agents communicate within a hierarchical structure, only interacting with their direct superiors, subordinates, or within their group.
   - Function Calls
     Communication includes file operations and code execution, with messages dispatched in a specified format. This ensures clear and efficient communication within the system.

This framework enables the MegaAgent to efficiently manage complex tasks by distributing workloads across multiple agents and
levels, ensuring that each task is completed with high accuracy and within a reasonable timeframe.
