This article discusses the rise of AI agents in 2024, highlighting their increasing popularity in the AI ecosystem but limited adoption among consumers and enterprises. 
The main focus is on defining agents, reviewing their structure and evolution, and addressing common challenges with AI agent architectures. 
Below is a breakdown of the key ideas, all based on the information provided:

1. Defining AI Agents
   -1. AI Agents
       Software systems that chain multiple processing steps, including LLM (Large Language Model) calls, to perform tasks. 
       They involve conditional logic, decision-making, and working memory between steps.
   -2. Modern Use
       New frameworks like LangGraph and LlamaIndex Workflows assist developers in building structured agents, 
       but widespread adoption is still limited outside the AI ecosystem.

2. The Evolution of AI Agents
    -1. First Generation (ReAct Agents)
        Early AI agents, known as ReAct (Reason, Act), were heavily abstracted but struggled with practical usability and effectiveness.
    -2. Second Generation Agents
        These agents reduce the "solution space" (the number of possible actions), making them more effective by narrowing down what the agent can do, 
        leading to more powerful and easier-to-manage systems.

3. Components of Agents
   -1. Router
       Directs the agent’s steps based on incoming data, typically powered by an LLM or a classifier. The router constantly decides the next action to take.
   -2. Components/Nodes
       Blocks of code that perform small tasks, such as LLM calls, API calls, or application logic. 
       In frameworks like LangGraph, these are nodes, while in LlamaIndex Workflows, they are steps.
   -3. Skills
       Groupings of components that handle specific tasks, such as processing a customer query to check an order’s shipping status.
   -4. Memory
       Tracks shared state across components, allowing the agent to carry context through its actions.

4. Agent Architectures
   Several common agent architectures are used in production:

   -1. Single Router with Functions
       The router decides which function to call based on input.
   -2. Single Router with Skills
       The router can call complex workflows or skill sets composed of multiple components, such as making API calls and generating responses.
   -3. Complex Branching Architectures
       These involve multiple branches, states, and LLM calls, requiring more sophisticated orchestration.

5. Agent Frameworks
   -1. LangGraph
       Uses nodes and conditional edges to determine the flow of an agent, rather than a single router.
   -2. LlamaIndex Workflows
       Utilizes events and event listeners for agents to handle data processing between steps. Each step manages events and broadcasts results to other steps.
   -3. Other Frameworks
       CrewAI, Autogen, and Swarm are also evolving in this space, allowing for multi-agent cooperation and more sophisticated architectures.

6. Key Questions for Agent Development
   -1. Framework vs. Code
       While frameworks like LangGraph and LlamaIndex provide structure and good tooling, 
       many teams (like the author's) prefer custom code for greater control over complex systems.
   -2. Need for an Agent
       Not all applications require an agent. If your system involves iterative flows, dynamic decision-making, or a state space of actions, an agent may be useful.

7. Common Challenges in Agent Development
   -1. Planning and Loops
       Agents often struggle with long-term planning and can get stuck in repetitive loops.
   -2. Inconsistent Performance
       The vast solution space (many possible actions and paths) can lead to unpredictable results and higher costs.

8. Solutions to Challenges
   -1. Narrow Solution Space
       Clearly defining the agent’s possible actions can reduce complexity.
   -2. Incorporate Domain Knowledge
       Adding business heuristics helps agents make better decisions.
   -3. Orchestrate with Code
       Using code-based orchestration rather than relying solely on LLMs can enhance determinism and reduce errors.

9. Conclusion
   AI agents are evolving from abstract, first-generation architectures to more defined and focused second-generation systems. 
   New frameworks help structure agent development, but developers must carefully consider when to use agents and how to mitigate challenges like planning and performance.
