1. The Hidden Efficiency Crisis in AI
   -a. Enterprise waste: Most large‐scale AI deployments run at only 15–20 % efficiency, meaning roughly $0.80 of every dollar
                         spent delivers no real value.
   -b. Three pain points:
       -1. Cost blowouts when trivial requests hit expensive, general‐purpose LLMs.
       -2. Slow responses (≥ 5 s) drive users away.
       -3. Engineering drag: 70 % of dev cycles spent on plumbing and integration rather than innovation.

2. Enter Smart Routing
   Think of your AI agents like airplanes and smart routing as the air-traffic control system that:
   -a. Analyzes each incoming query’s intent, complexity, and required expertise.
   -b. Selects the best‐suited specialized agent (lightweight for simple tasks, heavyweight only when needed).
   -c. Core Router Initialization
       """
       router = AIAgentRouter(
           llm_client = openai_client,
           agent_network = network,
           system_prompt = """
             You analyze queries to determine which specialized agent 
             would best handle the request based on topic, intent, 
             and complexity.
           """
       )
       """
   What it does: Instantiates a router that uses your LLM client to inspect queries and map them to domain agents.

3. Benefits of Smart Routing
   -a. Dramatic cost savings: Basic tasks go to tiny models (≈ 95 % cheaper).
   -b. Faster replies: Lightweight agents respond in milliseconds; heavyweight models reserved for edge cases.
   -c. Expert accuracy: Finance questions hit your “finance” agent, weather hits “weather,” etc.

4. Simple Routing in Practice
   Instead of always calling powerful_llm.generate(), you:
   """
   agent_name, confidence = router.route_query(query)
   if confidence < 0.7:
       return powerful_llm.generate(query)
   return network.get_agent(agent_name).ask(query)
   """
   -a. Fallback logic: Low‐confidence decisions default to your general LLM.
   -b. Result: Each query is funneled to the right tool, trimming cost and boosting accuracy.

5. Inside the Router’s Decision Logic
   -a. The router scores each agent on relevance:
       -1. e.g. Weather Agent: 0.96, Travel Agent: 0.43, …
   -b. It can extract entities and context (LOCATION, TIME, INTENT) to disambiguate:
       -1. Query: “Will I need an umbrella in Paris next week?”
       -2. Analysis: Weather: 0.89 → routed to Weather Agent.

6. Beyond One-Shot Routing: Conditional Workflows
   For multi‐step processes, you build flows that branch on intermediate results:
   """
   flow = (
     Flow(agent_network=network)
       .ask("weather", f"Weather in {city} this weekend?")
       .if_contains("rain")
         .ask("activities", f"Recommend indoor activities in {city}")
       .else_branch()
        .ask("activities", f"Recommend outdoor activities in {city}")
       .end_if()
   )
   result = flow.run_sync()
   """
   Outcome: Automated branching—no human in the loop once the weather query returns.

7. Speeding Up with Parallelism
   -a. Sequential: Four agent calls totaling ~12 s.
   -b. Parallel:
       """
       result = (
         Flow(agent_network=network)
           .parallel()
             .branch().ask("weather", ...)
             .branch().ask("attractions", ...)
             .branch().ask("restaurants", ...)
             .branch().ask("hotels", ...)
           .end_parallel(max_concurrency=4)
          .ask("planner", "Create itinerary using: {results}")
       ).run_sync()
       """
   -c. Effect: Cuts wall-clock time to the slowest branch (~4 s), drastically improving user experience.

8. Enriching Agents with External Tools (MCP)
   Agents become far more capable when they can call out to specialized functions:  
   """
   @mcp_tool
   def get_weather(location: str, days: int = 5) -> str:
       return weather_api.get_forecast(location, days)

   @mcp_tool
   def convert_currency(amount, from_currency, to_currency) -> float:
       return currency_api.convert(amount, from_currency, to_currency)
   """
   -a. How it works: The agent invokes these tools under the hood, seamlessly combining LLM reasoning with real‐time data.

9. Dynamic, Self-Organizing Agent Networks
   Automate discovery of running agents on your infrastructure:
   """
   network = AgentNetwork("Dynamic Network")
   urls = [f"http://localhost:{p}" for p in range(8000, 8101)]
   found_agents = discover_agents(urls)
   for url, card in found_agents.items():
       name = card["name"].lower().replace(" ", "_")
       network.add(name, url)
   """
   Benefit: Agents can join or leave without manual reconfiguration, enabling large-scale, distributed systems.

10. Quickstart: From Zero to Smart Routing in Minutes
    -a. Install:
        pip install "python-a2a[all]"
    -b. Create your network:
        """
        network = AgentNetwork("Smart Routing")
        network.add("weather", "http://localhost:8001")
        network.add("math",    "http://localhost:8002")
        network.add("knowledge","http://localhost:8003")
        """
   -c. Initialize router:
        """
        router = AIAgentRouter(
          llm_client=openai_client,
          agent_network=network,
          system_prompt="Route queries to the best specialized agent."
        )        
        """
   -d. Handle queries:
       """
        def handle_user_query(query):
            agent_name, confidence = router.route_query(query)
            return network.get_agent(agent_name).ask(query)
        """

Takeaway: By treating your AI ecosystem like managed traffic—analyzing each request, routing it to the right tool,
          and orchestrating parallel + conditional workflows—you cut costs, slash latency, and raise quality, all without adding hardware.
