The development of large language models (LLMs) has enabled AI agents to handle both conversational and complex reasoning tasks. 
In light of this dual responsibility, a Google DeepMind team has proposed a “Talker-Reasoner” architecture in their paper Agents Thinking Fast and Slow: 
A Talker-Reasoner Architecture.
This model is inspired by Daniel Kahneman's dual-system theory, which differentiates between fast, intuitive thinking (System 1) and slow, 
deliberative thinking (System 2).

In this architecture, the Talker component functions like System 1, rapidly generating intuitive, contextually informed responses, allowing fluid interactions.
Conversely, the Reasoner component acts as System 2, engaging in deeper reasoning, complex planning, and task execution.
This separation enables the Talker to maintain seamless user interaction, while the Reasoner processes complex problems in the background. 
When required, the Reasoner can intervene to ensure thoughtful, calculated decisions, especially for tasks that demand detailed, multi-step reasoning.

The team tested the model using a sleep coaching agent, 
where the Talker handled real-time conversations and the Reasoner managed detailed planning and adjustments to user guidance. 
This dual-system framework aims to enhance AI by effectively balancing conversational responsiveness with complex reasoning capabilities,
potentially leading to more versatile and adaptive agents.

### System1 vs System2
System 1 and System 2 are terms used to describe two distinct modes of thinking, introduced by psychologist Daniel Kahneman in his book Thinking, 
Fast and Slow. The concepts help explain how people process information, make decisions, and solve problems:

-1. System 1 (Fast Thinking)
    This is our intuitive, automatic, and quick-thinking system. It operates almost effortlessly, reacting based on experience, instincts, and learned patterns. 
    System 1 is great for making quick, snap judgments, but it is more prone to biases and errors. 
    Examples of System 1 thinking include recognizing faces, understanding simple sentences, or reacting quickly to danger.

-2. System 2 (Slow Thinking)
    This is our analytical, deliberate, and effortful thinking system. 
    It takes more time and energy to engage, allowing us to reflect, analyze, and make complex decisions. 
    System 2 thinking kicks in when tasks require logic, critical thinking, or concentration. 
    Examples include solving a complex math problem, planning a trip, or evaluating abstract concepts.

In daily life, most decisions are handled by System 1 for efficiency, while System 2 is reserved for more challenging or unfamiliar situations. 
The balance between these two systems helps us function quickly in routine situations but gives us the ability to handle new or complex problems when necessary.
