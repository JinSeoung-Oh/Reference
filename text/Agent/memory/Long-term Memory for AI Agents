1. Context and Motivation:
   The notion of “agentic AI systems” has recently gained attention. 
   While generative AI models (like large language models, or LLMs) can produce text and answer questions, 
   their capabilities are limited when it comes to autonomously performing multi-step tasks, adapting to changing goals, 
   and integrating with external enterprise systems over extended periods of time. 
   Agentic AI aims to fill these gaps by endowing AI with the capacity to break down user goals into subtasks, 
   orchestrate workflows across multiple tools or services, and maintain stateful, long-term behavior.

2. Agentic AI vs. Generative AI and LLM Agents:
   -a. Generative AI:
       Traditional generative AI solutions—like a standalone LLM—excel at producing human-like text given a prompt, but operate on a single-turn, 
       short-lived basis. They don’t inherently remember past interactions beyond their immediate context window, nor do they autonomously plan multi-step solutions.

   -b. LLM Agents:
       Early “LLM agents” are basically LLMs augmented with the ability to call external functions (e.g., via specialized prompts or APIs). 
       While a step forward, such agents typically rely heavily on the reasoning capabilities of LLMs alone for task decomposition and planning. 
       They may respond to a user’s query by planning a few steps, but their memory and capabilities to run over hours, days, or months is limited.

   -c. Agentic AI Systems:
       In contrast, agentic AI introduces a more robust orchestration layer. 
       Given a user’s high-level goal (e.g., “Generate and execute a month-long email marketing campaign to achieve $1 million in sales”), an agentic system can:

       -1. Decompose the goal into subtasks (e.g., analyze products, identify audience segments, create tailored email campaigns).
       -2. Integrate with external systems (like a CRM) to fetch data, send emails, and track results.
       -3. Monitor the campaign’s performance over time and adapt if it’s not on track to meet the sales goal (e.g., try alternative products, perform A/B testing).

   This continuous monitoring and adaptation differentiates agentic AI from simple question-answering. It’s not just generating content; it’s executing tasks, observing outcomes, and iterating strategies.

3. Key Requirements for Agentic AI:
   -a. Orchestration and Planning: 
       Agentic AI relies on a planning or orchestration layer that can break down complex user requests into manageable subtasks. 
       Often, LLMs are used to reason about these tasks. However, this means the system’s capabilities are currently limited by LLM reasoning strengths and weaknesses.
   -b. Integration with External Systems:
       Real enterprise use cases typically require reading/writing from databases, CRMs, ERP systems, or other internal tools. 
       Protocols like the Model Context Protocol (MCP) enable connecting AI agents to such systems, 
       providing them with fresh data and allowing them to take real actions (e.g., sending emails, updating records).
   -c. Long-Term Memory Management: 
       Agentic tasks can run for extended periods (hours, days, even months), necessitating robust memory management. 
       The agent must recall decisions made previously, data fetched from external systems, and outcomes of prior actions. 
       This is far beyond the short-term, ephemeral memory of a single LLM prompt.

4. Current Memory Solutions and Their Limitations:
   -a. Vector Databases for Conversational Memory: 
       Today, many conversational agents rely on vector databases to store and retrieve relevant context. The approach involves:
       -1. Encoding textual information (e.g., past dialogues, documents) into vector embeddings.
       -2. Storing these embeddings in a vector database.
       -3. On query, computing a vector representation of the prompt and retrieving the closest matches from the DB to supply extra context.
       This method helps ground the LLM’s responses, reducing hallucinations and ensuring answers can be based on actual enterprise data. 
       It works well for Q&A and simple context recall, but has limitations for more complex and persistent memory needs.

   -b. Data Quality in Vector DBs: With vector databases, data quality concerns arise:
       -1. Accuracy and Groundedness: If the underlying documents or embeddings are outdated or factually incorrect, the agent’s responses may suffer.
       -2. Completeness and Consistency: Missing data or inconsistent embeddings can cause disjointed, incoherent responses. 
                                         For instance, incomplete product data might lead to flawed marketing campaigns.
       -3. Timeliness: If embeddings are not updated as source data changes, the agent might rely on stale information.
       While enterprises have well-established data quality rules for structured SQL data, similar standards and processes for vector-based,
       unstructured data are still emerging.

5. Expanding Beyond Vector Databases: The article argues that agentic AI requires more than just “conversational memory” 
   (i.e., pulling relevant Q&A pairs from a vector store). For agents to behave more like humans, they need additional types of memory:

   -a. Semantic Memory:
       This is general world knowledge—facts, concepts, and domain expertise. 
       Currently, some semantic knowledge is baked into LLMs during pre-training. 
       However, continuously enriching and updating this semantic layer (e.g., with new product info or evolving market conditions) may require 
       additional knowledge representation formats beyond just vector embeddings.

    -b. Episodic Memory:
        Agents need to remember past episodes—specific events, attempts, and the historical context of tasks. 
        For example, the agent should recall what strategies it tried last week, what worked, what didn’t, and how the environment responded. 
        Vector DBs can store snapshots of past interactions, but episodic memory involves structuring these episodes in a way that the agent 
        can replay or reason about them effectively over the long run.

    -c. Procedural Memory:
        This relates to “how-to” knowledge—workflow steps, instructions, processes, and the correct sequence of actions. 
        For instance, a marketing agent may need to remember how to perform A/B tests: not just the concept, but the step-by-step procedure. 
        Storing and retrieving this knowledge might be more naturally done through structured representations like finite state machines (FSMs) 
        or graphs rather than just vector embeddings.

    -d. Emotional Memory (Optional):
        While more speculative, emotional memory would allow the agent to keep track of user preferences, sentiment, and reactions over time, 
        enabling more personalized and empathetic interactions.

6. A Proposed Architecture for Agentic Memory: The article proposes a layered memory architecture:

   -a. Memory Router:
       Routes new queries or tasks to either long-term memory (LTM) or short-term memory (STM). 
       If a known pattern is found in LTM, it can produce a response immediately.

   -b. Short-Term Memory (STM):
       Analogous to human working memory, STM deals with immediate context—like the last few steps, current user instructions, 
       or recently fetched data. Tools and APIs can be called to bring additional information into STM.

   -c. Long-Term Memory (LTM):
       Stores semantic, episodic, and procedural knowledge:
       -1. Semantic Layer: Can still leverage vector databases for general and domain-specific knowledge.
       -2. Episodic Memory: Past experiences structured in a knowledge graph, allowing the agent to recall what happened, when, and under which conditions.
       -3. Procedural Memory: Represented via finite state machines, or other structured methods, 
                              to remember how to perform certain sequences of actions or workflows reliably.
7. STM–LTM Transformer Module:
   Continuously transforms working memory items and newly gathered context into long-term representations. 
   For example, it might take a series of steps performed by the agent, summarize them, and store them as an “episode” in a knowledge graph. 
   It might also extract procedural patterns and store them in a structured workflow representation.

8. Conclusion and Future Directions
   Memory management is the backbone of agentic AI. While vector databases and embeddings are effective for conversational Q&A memory and basic retrieval, 
   they are not sufficient for the richer, more varied memory needs of agentic AI tasks:

   -a. Episodic Memory: For recalling past attempts, successes, and failures.
   -b. Procedural Memory: For codifying skill-like sequences of actions.
   -c. Semantic Memory: For robust and updated domain knowledge.

   The article suggests exploring other knowledge representation frameworks—like knowledge graphs for episodic memory and state machines 
   or formal workflow representations for procedural memory. 
   These will complement vector databases and help achieve the true promise of agentic AI: 
   dynamic, long-lived, adaptable systems that can operate in complex, changing environments, just as a human would.

   By putting these pieces together—LLMs for reasoning, vector DBs for semantic context, knowledge graphs for episodic memory, 
   FSMs for procedural routines—agentic AI can evolve from a simple prompt-response paradigm to a robust framework for autonomous problem-solving 
   and long-term adaptation.
