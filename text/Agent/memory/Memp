1. Capabilities and Limitations of Current LLM Agents
   Large language model (LLM) agents have advanced to the point of handling complex tasks such as web research, report generation, 
   data analysis, and multi-step software workflows. 
   However, they struggle with procedural memory — the form of memory that allows agents (or humans) to internalize, 
   automate, and reuse routines for recurring tasks. Today, procedural memory in agents is often rigid, manually designed, 
   or locked inside model weights, making it fragile. 
   Unexpected changes like network failures or UI updates frequently force a full restart. 
   Unlike humans, who learn by reusing past experiences as routines, current LLM agents lack systematic ways to build, refine, 
   and reuse procedural skills.

2. Limitations of Existing Memory Approaches
   Current systems use methods such as vector embeddings, semantic search, and hierarchical structures to store and retrieve short-term, 
   episodic, and long-term memory. 
   However, strategies for constructing, updating, and reusing procedural memory remain underdeveloped. 
   Even with reinforcement learning, imitation, or replay, agents face inefficiency, poor generalization, and catastrophic forgetting.

3. Introduction of Memp Framework
   Researchers from Zhejiang University and Alibaba Group propose Memp, a framework that equips agents with lifelong, 
   adaptable procedural memory. Memp converts past trajectories into:
   -a. fine-grained step-level instructions, and
   -b. higher-level abstract scripts.
       It systematically addresses memory construction, retrieval, and updating.

4.Dynamic Memory Management in Memp
  Unlike static approaches, Memp continuously refines knowledge through addition, validation, reflection, and discarding. 
  This ensures that agents maintain relevant and efficient procedural knowledge, 
  reducing wasted exploration and keeping knowledge up-to-date.

5. Experimental Validation (ALFWorld, TravelPlanner)
   -a. Storing and reusing trajectories improved accuracy, shortened exploration time, and optimized token usage.
   -b. Semantic similarity–based retrieval further enhanced relevant memory access.
   -c. Dynamic update mechanisms allowed error correction, pruning outdated knowledge, and refining skills over time.
   -d. Crucially, procedural memory built by stronger models successfully transferred to weaker models, yielding significant performance gains.
   -e. However, scaling retrieval beyond an optimal threshold caused context overload, reducing effectiveness.

6. Conclusion and Significance
   Memp is a task-agnostic procedural memory framework that treats memory as central to optimizing LLM agents. 
   By systematically managing memory construction, retrieval, and updating, it enables agents to distill, refine, 
   and reuse past experiences, leading to greater efficiency and accuracy in long-horizon tasks such as TravelPlanner and ALFWorld. 
   Unlike static or manually engineered approaches, Memp evolves dynamically, ensuring adaptability and continual improvement. 
   Looking ahead, richer retrieval strategies and self-assessment mechanisms can further enhance real-world robustness and adaptability.
