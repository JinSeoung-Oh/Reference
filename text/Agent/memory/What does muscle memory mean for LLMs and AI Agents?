1. Muscle Memory: The Core Analogy
   -a. Human Learning vs. LLMs
       -1. Human “Muscle Memory”: After repeated practice—like snowboarding—actions become automatic and fast. Catching an edge 
           or making a turn requires no conscious thought, enabling higher speeds and reducing crashes.
       -2. LLMs (Large Language Models): They effectively “re-learn” the same tasks every time, spending the same amount of tokens 
           and compute resources. They do not gain “speed” from repeated exposure to the same tasks.
       -3. Conclusion: Practice does more than just improve accuracy; it accelerates reaction time. LLMs currently lack this built-in mechanism 
                       to reduce their processing costs or speed up repeated tasks automatically.
   -b. Speed vs. Reaction Time
       -a. A rider’s reaction time (0.1s vs. 1s) massively impacts the maximum speed at which they can recover from losing an edge. Humans can train to lower this “mental reaction time”—LLMs cannot (in their current form) do the same.
       -b. The text uses a simplified equation T(crit)=distance to recover/velocity
           T(crit)=distance to recover/velocity to demonstrate that a 1s reaction time is only viable at very low speeds (5–10 km/h in the example), 
           while 0.1s or 0.01s allow progressively higher speeds.

2. Why LLMs Need “Muscle Memory”
   -a. Current Model Behavior
       -1. Repeated use of an LLM does not reduce the token cost or time. The same query repeated 10,000 times yields the same overhead 
           in tokens and compute.
       -2. Moore’s Law might reduce the cost of compute over time, but it doesn’t reduce the LLM’s per-task overhead from “learning by repetition.”
   -b. Agentic Systems
       -1. The text argues that AI agents should develop “muscle memory”—purpose-specific, optimized subroutines—that allow them to bypass 
           the large LLM for repetitive tasks.
       -2. Rather than always calling the big, expensive model, an agent can train smaller, specialized “mini-models” or “fast routes” 
           after enough experience doing the same tasks repeatedly.
   -c. Specialized / Tuned Models
       -1. Building “muscle memory” means the agent might create a specialized model for a specific set of tasks 
           (like a smaller vision model for detecting animals in trail-cam images). 
           Over time, this model can be fine-tuned for its environment and become extremely quick and efficient, 
           bypassing the LLM for 80%+ of routine decisions.

3. Example: Trail-Cam Image Classification
   -a. Current Setup
       -1. The author uses a general-purpose YOLO model for fast, cheap detection of whether there’s an animal in an image.
       -2. Once YOLO thinks there’s an animal, a more expensive LLM step is used to identify the species.
   -b. Muscle Memory Improvement
       -1. Over time, the agent can fine-tune that high-speed model on the specific animals appearing in the camera’s region.
       -2. Eventually, confidence thresholds can be adjusted so that if the model is sure, it skips LLM verification entirely, 
           dramatically reducing time/cost.
       -3. Some sampling or post-check would still exist to catch mistakes, but it would not happen on every single image.

4. Self-Labotomizing (“Carving Out a Purpose”)
   -a. Trimming Unnecessary Parameters
       -1. An LLM might “carve out” or remove unused knowledge to become “stupidly effective” at one narrow task.
       -2. This parallels how a surfer may not be adept at astrophysics, but is elite at surfing maneuvers—deep skill in one domain but lesser in others.
       -3. Agentic AI can do this by re-training or pruning a model to keep only the domain-specific skill it needs.

5. Throwing More Hardware Isn’t the (Sole) Solution
   -a. Environmental & Practical Constraints
       -1. Relying on brute-force compute to speed up LLM responses is power-hungry and doesn’t fundamentally solve the slow reaction-time limitation.
       -2. In high-frequency tasks or low-latency domains (e.g., automated trading), even “1 second” is too slow.
   -b. Adaptive Agentic Systems
       -1. Agents that learn to optimize themselves—building specialized sub-models or “muscle memory”—are more likely to provide
           genuine performance gains over time, rather than just scaling up the base model.

6. Conclusion
   -a. Future AI: The “bigger is better” approach (larger and larger LLMs) may be supplemented—or even superseded—by agent-based systems that learn,
                  tune, and “muscle-memorize” tasks for faster, cheaper execution.
   -b. Implication: We’ll see an evolution toward specialized, self-improving agent architectures that handle recurring tasks far 
                    more efficiently than a general-purpose LLM can.
