1. Overview
   Dragon Hatchling (BDH) is a biologically inspired large language model designed as a scale-free graph of locally interacting neuron-like units.
   It employs excitatory and inhibitory spiking neurons with Hebbian learning to emulate synaptic plasticity, enabling reasoning and memory across hundreds of tokens.
   BDH matches GPT-2 in both performance and scaling behavior while remaining GPU-efficient.
   Its activations are sparse, positive, and monosemantic, ensuring intrinsic interpretability and clear concept representations.
   Theoretical work connects BDH’s attention dynamics with those observed in the human brain, proposing a unified set of “equations of reasoning.”
   Overall, BDH offers a biologically grounded framework for large-scale reasoning, aiming toward thermodynamic-limit and PAC-like generalization bounds for reasoning over time.

2. The Approach
   (a) Formalism for Local Graph-Based Language Models
       -1. BDH functions as a distributed computing system where local computation occurs at neuron-like nodes and information travels along weighted edges.
       -2. The model’s behavior is defined by a scheduler and local kernel, specifying how nodes compute and communicate.
       -3. Computation and communication alternate in four cyclic kernels, forming BDH’s reasoning dynamics.
       -4. The graph itself acts as a program — topology and weights determine how reasoning unfolds.
       -5. The formalism draws from evolutionary dynamics and chemical reaction networks, where entities interact probabilistically and evolve state over time.
       -6. Thus, BDH is an edge-reweighting distributed graph system, where reasoning emerges from local updates governed by mathematically grounded, biologically inspired rules.
   (b) Attention as a Micro-Inductive Bias of Reasoning
       -1. Each edge between neurons acts as a micro-program that transforms and passes information.
       -2. Local rules (e.g., updating weights or transmitting activations) govern neuron interactions; 
           collectively, they form a distributed circuit where nodes compute and edges store memory.
       -3. The system dynamically selects which implications to activate next — guided by contextual usefulness, much like human reasoning.
       -4. Hence, attention weights represent probabilistic reasoning utilities:
           -1) They encode which implications are likely to be followed next.
           -2) As edges activate, reasoning paths form through the network, enabling inference chains from source to target concepts.
   (c) Expressing BDH Through Brain Models
       -1. BDH shows that a biologically inspired neural circuit can achieve Transformer-level reasoning and language ability.
       -2. Its four-step loop mirrors brain processes:
           -1) Neurons fire and compete via excitatory/inhibitory dynamics.
           -2) Synapses strengthen or weaken locally through Hebbian plasticity.
           -3) Signal transmission adapts dynamically.
       -3. This implies that Hebbian learning + neural circuitry are both necessary and sufficient for large-scale reasoning.
           -1) Hebbian learning functions as unsupervised attention, adjusting connection strengths to sustain inference.
       -4. Supervised learning in the brain may gradually consolidate short-term synaptic changes into long-term weight updates.
       -5. The BDH framework thus connects cognitive processes (seconds/minutes) with spiking/plasticity dynamics, 
           offering a biologically coherent explanation of reasoning across timescales.
   (d) BDH-GPU: Tensor-Friendly Implementation
       -1. A state-space, tensorized version of BDH for efficient GPU execution.
       -2. Defines three core parameter matrices evolving recurrently over time steps (tokens) and layers.
       -3. Each step updates neuron states, activations, outputs, and attention-like values — combining local and temporal computation.
       -4. Processes one token per step: encoding → recurrence → decoding.
       -5. Positional structure is encoded via diagonal or block-diagonal matrices performing local rotation/damping (analogous to ALiBi or RoPE).

3. Analysis: Emergence of Modularity and Scale-Free Structure
   (a) ReLU-Lowrank Block
       -1. Replaces the Transformer’s feed-forward MLP with a simpler, biologically interpretable ReLU-lowrank module operating entirely in the positive domain.
       -2. Uses three matrices to project activations into a low-dimensional space, reconstruct, and apply ReLU.
       -3. Despite smaller hidden dimension, stacked ReLU-lowrank layers can approximate arbitrary vector functions, 
           maintaining Transformer-like expressiveness but slower convergence.
   (b) Mathematical Function
       -1. Improves upon plain low-rank mappings by filtering noise.
       -2. Without ReLU, low-rank mappings distort signals; with ReLU + bias, they accurately approximate Markov-like propagation on sparse positive vectors.
       -3. ReLU serves as a thresholding and denoising mechanism, converting weak or noisy activations into clean, interpretable representations.

✅ In essence:
BDH unifies biologically plausible neural dynamics with Transformer-level language reasoning.
It frames attention as probabilistic inference, learning as synaptic adaptation, and reasoning as dynamic graph evolution 
— offering a concrete step toward biologically grounded “equations of thought.”
