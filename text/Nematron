Nvidia has announced the release of Nemotron-4–340B, the largest open-source large language model (LLM) to date.
Available in three versions—Base, Reward, and Instruct—this model is designed to aid researchers and developers in creating their own LLMs as part of a synthetic data generation pipeline.
It is an advanced version of Nemotron-4–340B-Base, specifically optimized for English-based single and multi-turn chat applications, and supports a context length of up to 4,096 tokens.

The base model was initially trained on a massive corpus of 9 trillion tokens, encompassing a wide variety of English texts, over 50 natural languages, 
and more than 40 programming languages. The Nemotron-4–340B-Instruct model underwent further refinement through several alignment steps, 
including Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and Reward-aware Preference Optimization (RPO), 
a proprietary alignment technique. During the alignment process, approximately 20,000 human-annotated data points were utilized,
while a data generation pipeline synthesized over 98% of the data used for supervised fine-tuning and preference fine-tuning (DPO & RPO).

As a result, the model is finely tuned for human chat preferences, excels in mathematical reasoning, coding, 
and instruction-following, and is capable of generating high-quality synthetic data for various applications.

The following table shows how Nematron 4 compares to its closest open-source rivals in a range of standard reasoning benchmarks. Bold figures indicate the best scores.

Users can access the Nemotron 4 340B model through Nvidia NIM or LM Studio. Creating an account on Nvidia NIM provides access to many useful models.

After testing the Nemotron 4 340B model with various logic, math, programming, and reasoning questions, 
it was found to provide highly accurate and detailed answers to most questions. It excelled particularly in solving mathematical problems, 
generating programming code, and responding to real-life scenario questions. The model correctly answered 6 out of 7 questions, 
demonstrating very impressive performance compared to other available open-source models.

In conclusion, Nemotron is an extremely capable model, slightly ahead of the recent Qwen 2 model but still a bit behind the Llama 70B and GPT-4 based models.
